<p><font color="#FFCC00"><font size=+1>Create an Orc and Join Us!
<br>
<br>Start roleplaying and set up guildstone
war with us, or join a guildstone already at war with us
<br>
<br>Roleplay with us, respect us as
players, and understand what we are trying to do.
<br>
<br>We don't tolerate Humie company
for long so never think yourself a Shadow Clan friend, even if we say you
are :).&nbsp; If you helped us, did the Food Trick or talked to us in the
past don't expect amnesty from Orc hostilities.&nbsp; As the old Orcish
saying goes,"Orc have many bad hair days and short memory".
