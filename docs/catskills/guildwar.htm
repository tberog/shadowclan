<br><br>
<font color="#FFCC00"><font size=+1>Shadowclan uses guildwar to recognize
other&nbsp; players interested in interacting with Shadowclan.&nbsp; Setting
up guildwar with shadowclan does not mean you will be attacked on sight
everytime you encounter an orc.&nbsp; It does mean you will be able to
interact with us without any fear of being criminal flagged or getting
murder counts.&nbsp; Due to the annoymous nature of murder reporting, we
can make no guareentees regarding murder counts if you do not have guildwar
set up with us.

<br><br>We only have a few simple rules
for setting up and maintaining guildwar status.&nbsp; We declare war on
guilds that:</font>

<br><br>(A) want to roleplay with shadowclan
with the possibility of player versus player fighting,

<br>(B) are committed to improving their
roleplay,

<br>(C) do not allow the use of illegal
external programs (same policy as OSI on that) or bug exploitation,

<br>(D) respect the people who play
the orcs, out of character,

<br>(E) follow simplified rules of engagement
(SRoE),

<br>(F) have control of their members
such that repeat problem makers, members with no interest in respecting
others, and/or members that do not attempt to roleplay are kicked off of
their guildstone.

<br>(G) will declare on all the Shadowclan
guildstones, and will not seek to attack the orcs until guildwar is mutually
declared with the majority of clan guildstones

<br>(H) will seek to work out agreements
to set up guildstone war with other roleplay guilds that are allies of
shadowclan (it is understood that sometimes such agreements will not be
able to be worked out).

<br>(I) will loot only what the looter
himself has a use for (so don't loot armor unless you plan on wearing it,
or don't loot weapons unless you are going to use them yourself).

<br>(J) have their guild titles turned ON
</font>
<br><br><br>
<font color="#FF0000"><font size=+2>The simple rules of engagement (SRoE)
are:</font></font>
<br><br>
<font color="#FFCC00">
(1) do not attack players that obviously
have lost connection,

<br>(2) after resurrecting, a player
remains in death robes, and doesn't talk, and doesn't participate further in that battle. Death robed
players that follow this rule are not to be attacked. Death robed players may loot their own
corpses.

<br><br><br><br>
<font size=+1>
In order to help us keep our members
out of towns (what business do orcs have in town anyways?), members of
guilds we are at war with are encouraged to attack orcs on sight in towns.
