<p><font color="#FFFF99">The human virtue system is based upon the three
principles, Truth, Love, and Courage. From the possible combinations of
the 3 principles, the eight virtues are formed. Valor (Courage), Compassion
(Love), Honesty (Truth), Justice (Truth and Love), Sacrifice (Love and
Courage), Honor (Courage and Truth), Spirituality (Truth, Love and Courage),
and Humility (none). Each virtue has an associated character class and
city.&nbsp; Fighters have their Valor, Paladins their Honor, Magicians
- Honesty, Bards Compassion, Druids Justice, Rangers Spirituality, Tinkers
Sacrifice, and Shepards Humility.</font><font color="#FFFF99"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">The gargoyles of Ultima VI had a different society
than the humans. The gargoyles thus had a different set of 3 principles
- Passion, Control and Diligence. From these 8 gargoyle virtues were formed
in a manner similar to the human virtue system.</font><font color="#FFFF99"></font>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">The Orcs of the Shadow Clan, the largest orc community
ever, have been given by the wargod the knowledge of their own orc virtue
system. The orcish word for orc virtue is "urucku". The orcish society
is fierocious and deticated to war. The urucku's reflect that. Because
the orcish mindset is different than a humans, many of the orcish words
are conceptual and difficult to precisely translate into English. The 3
major orcish principles are Clog (might makes right), Snarf (wicked cleverness/quickness),
and Faugh (deception). The various combinations form the eight urucku's,
and each urucku has a bloodline that follows it:</font>
<p><font color="#FFCC00">Ogba (Clog) means "brutality", the way of the
Womp-R</font>
<br><font color="#FFCC00">Iggju (Snarf) means "fighting tactics", the way
of the Kigg-R</font>
<br><font color="#FFCC00">Aughhagh (Faugh) means "deceit", the way of the
A-sas-sun</font>
<br><font color="#FFCC00">Kihagh (Clog and Snarf) means "bloodlust", the
way of the Lusk-R</font>
<br><font color="#FFCC00">Gagru (Clog and Faugh) means "deceptive might",
the way of the Ligz-R</font>
<br><font color="#FFCC00">Rokgagh (Faugh and Snarf) means "deceptive tactics",
the way of the Zult-R</font>
<br><font color="#FFCC00">Ghigneh (Clog, Faugh, and Snarf) means "connection
to the wargod", the way of the Mojoka</font>
<br><font color="#FFCC00">Buorca (none) means "obediance, teamwork for
a greater purpose", the way of the MakR</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">There is also the Sneek-R bloodline. Sneek-Rs
follow the way of Highat (means "sneekiness"). Highat is not a true orc
urucku, but has a goblin influence. Shadow Clan barely tolerates the presence
of the annoying Sneek-Rs, but they somehow manage to not be banned from
the fort, most likely by bribeing the orc leaders.&nbsp; Like the human
virtues, each orc urucku has its own shrine. It is rumored that each urucku
also has its own mantra and gemstone, and perhaps other secrets closely
guarded by the bludline.</font>
