<p>
<font color="#FFCC00"><font size=+1>Long ago in forgotten
history it is believed that the Orcs were created by a malevolent wizard.
The humans first recorded sighting is of a single orc appearing in a farmer's
field. Despite the fact that only a malevolent wizard would have created
the orc and not stepped forward, the people refused to admit that a new
power of evil was growing in the land of Sosaria.

&nbsp;
<p>

The Guardian is the
God of the Orcs. They do not speak of him as the Guardian but as the WarGod.
Since many years have passed since the last evil wizard had controlled
the Orcs, they have forgotten much of what they were made to do.

&nbsp;
<p>

The creation of The
Fellowship was an elaborate plot set up by The Guardian to gain access
to Britannia. Disguising his words as the "inner voice", The Guardian charmed
members of The Fellowship into building The Black Gate. The Black Gate
was a Blackrock construction built by members of The Fellowship in the
caverns near the Shrine of The Codex on The Isle of The Avatar. It was
meant to serve as the portal through which The Guardian would enter Britannia.
Blackrock is a rare substance that is still shrouded in mystery. A mine
near Vesper is the only place in Britannia where Blackrock is rumored to
be found. What has been determined is that under the influence of magic,
electrical and magnetic energy, and the celestial bodies, Blackrock constructions
can act as gateways between dimensions. It was The Guardian's intention
to enter Britannia during the Astronomical Alignment.

&nbsp;
<p>

This threat to Britannia
was uncovered.The three generators were destroyed that corrupted the magical
Ether(the cause of the insanity among the mages), disrupted the workings
of the moongates,and enabled The Guardian to talk to Britannia's citizens.

&nbsp;
<p>

Today the Orcs are
working feverishly to build their power and seek the return of the WarGod.
Recently during the WarBoss Challenge the WarGod was summoned, for a brief
period, with a hidious ritual and spoke directly to his Orcish followers.
The Guardian is also spreading his Unholy powers through out the other
races. Even evil human mages and cults are believed to be secretly worshipping
the Guardian.

&nbsp;
<p>

The power of the
WarGod is growing. Not only have the strength and numbers of the Orcs grown,
but also their influence over humanity is gaining. The Orcs now have power
to cause insanity. It appears after some social contact with Orcs some
humans are corrupted. These weak willed humans have been known to babble
in the orcish language. They are also tricked by Orcs into many evil acts
against their own race. Orcs love to see human fight humans. Orcs still
do not trust these insane humans but tolerate them for short periods of
time. The WarGods influences these insane humans to further his cause which
makes the ShandowClan stronger.&nbsp; As the ShadowClan grows so to does
the Guardian's influence over the common humans that populate the land.
