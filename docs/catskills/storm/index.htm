<blockquote> 
  <div align="left">
    <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">From boats 
      made by Throquat paws, a horde of orcs swarmed the docks of Serpent's Hold. 
      The many Tribes were strong together, followed by Tribeless and Gruntees 
      ready for the pillage. The unprepared townsfolk were slaughtered, few left 
      as prisoners. The Byzantines, who had found perfection in Serpent's Hold 
      as a new place to defend and live, grew alert as billows of smoke rolled 
      from burning hay roofs in the main town. The army set up at the chapel as 
      the orcs gathered in the archery butte territory to spread out their loot 
      and the bodies of the dead. Rain fell from the sky of heavy gray clouds, 
      lightning flashed and thunder rolled. Battle stirred in the hearts of beasts 
      and man.</font></p>

</div>
<blockquote>
  <div align="left"> 
    <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Ghosts must 
      remain entirely away from fighting for the thirty minutes after gathering 
      the items from their bodies. Ghost robes must be worn for the full time. 
      Ghosts report to </font><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">their 
      appropriate locations. Human ghosts wait in the specified blue building, 
      and orcs wait in the specified red building. See the map below for location 
      details.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> Ghosts should 
      be weary and wear their robes on the way to their base, then derobe at their 
      base. They cannot wear robes longer than is necessary at their own base. 
      </font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">No ghost spying.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Main battles 
      will be led on the orc side by the Warboss and on the human side by the 
      Byzantine leader. Skirmishes may be led by any interested and present character. 
      Once a battle, skirmish, or other interaction is complete, it is important 
      to return to one's own base and not camp the other guilds' territory.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> It is encouraged 
      to do more than fight. Be clever about confrontation. Attempt to have some 
      face to face talk or exchange before the attack begins. This is to avoid 
      KoS'ing of any characters. </font></p>
