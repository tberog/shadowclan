<p><font color="#FFCC00"><font size=+1>To have fun and provide some fun
for those that oppose us.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may not always be like this but
the current UO world has many a player who has nothing to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They have maxed out, have all the gold they could ever need and find little
enjoyment in the game.&nbsp; We hope to provide a little role-played rivalry
between us and the humans in the area.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have developed into
an active round the clock player run orc village based out of an orc fort.&nbsp;
We seek to defend our land rights against others with who we are at war.</font></font>
