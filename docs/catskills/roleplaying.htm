<p><font color="#FFCC00"><font size=+1>We act and talk In-Character (IC)
as an orc would.&nbsp;&nbsp; If any orc does not attempt at least basic
role-playing s/he will be striped of his/her clan respect (Rank and Title),
and severly beaten.&nbsp; Also if this behavior presists they will be driven
from the clan forced to roam the lands of Sosaria as a lone orc and to
be treated as a ShadowClan enemy.&nbsp; Power-Gaming (focusing on stats
and skills or use of external macro programs) and acting out-of-character
(OOC)&nbsp; is not tolerated in Shadowclan.&nbsp; It is very important
that these ideas be followed in order to promote roleplaying and maintain
the respect we have earned as roleplayers.</font></font>
