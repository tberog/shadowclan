            <i>The power of the Wargod is growing. Not only has the strength and 
            numbers of the Orcs grown, but also their influence over humanity 
            is gaining. The Orcs now have power to cause insanity. It appears 
            after some social contact with Orcs some humans are corrupted. These 
            weak-willed humans have been known to babble in the orcish language. 
            They are also tricked by Orcs into many evil acts against their own 
            race. Orcs love to see humans fight humans. Orcs still do not trust 
            these insane humans but tolerate them for short periods of time. The 
            Wargod influences these insane humans to further his cause which makes 
            the ShadowClan stronger. As the ShadowClan grows so to does the Wargod's 
            influence over the common humans that populate the land... <font color="#CC9966">&quot;</font></i></font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Each BloodMoon 
          orc has his own way of serving the Wargod but many choose to align themselves 
          within a certain caste within the tribe. There are four seperate Castes 
          within the BloodMoon tribe.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">A Caste is chosen 
          by a Convert and either the top rank of the Caste or a Nob sends the 
          Convert on an appropriate quest. After the quest, the Convert is told 
          whether he is accepted into the Caste or not. If rejected, he may choose 
          another caste right away, or he may reapply for the same one after a 
          month passes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> An orc who wishes 
          to switch castes must write a story about it and have some in-game interaction 
          that relates to his story and caste switching (details to be worked 
          out by the orc in question).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> This is by no 
          means meant to tell you how to play your orc. They are merely some suggestions 
          and those who don't wish to participate in the intra-tribe rankings 
          are not forced to. Expect promotions to be handed out very infrequently. 
          Only through LONG hard work and true devotion to the Wargod, Tribe and 
          Clan can an orc expect to achieve the top ranks. Promotions based upon 
          RP ability, devotion and sacrifice to the Moonies and the Clan, contributions 
          to the orc experience and the amount of respect you get from other orcs 
          and even other roleplayers. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b><font color="#CC9966">Fanatic 
          Caste:</font> </b>These are orcs who are completely and utterly devoted 
          to the Wargod and the Moonies. They will often try to protect other 
          orcs in their tribe, feeling they should take the brunt of any combat. 
          They are ferocious in battle, but realize that living to fight another 
          day is sometimes the wiser course. Fanatics often believe that the cause 
          of any losing battle is the anger of the Wargod. This makes them feel 
          guilty and they will take whatever steps they feel appropriate to obtain 
          the favor of the Wargod again.<br>

          are fearless in battle, no matter what the odds and will fight to the 
          death defending the honor of the Moonies and the Wargod. They view death 
          as just another chance to see the Wargod and are quite often disappointed 
          when a battle doesn't lead to their own death. Martyrs fully believe 
          in the Power of the Wargod over everything. Anything that occurs, good 
          or bad, is the Will of the Wargod. They will often work themselves into 
          a battle fervor before a fight, chanting and mumbling prayers and devotions 
          to the Wargod. Upon gaining the first rank they are taught to read battle 
          scars.<br>

          Caste:</font> </b>These are orcs who are devoted to spreading the Word 
          of the Wargod, to both orcs and non-orcs. They tend to be a little more 
          philosophical than most orcs and can often be found shouting out the 
          Words of the Wargod, whether anyone is listening or not. Many a time 
          has a human warrior been distracted by a Preacher yelling about the 
          Wargod as he fights. Orcs of this caste tend to lead many preaching 
          trips to human settlements.<br>

          They will often have dreams and visions of the Wargod and will sometimes 
          consume plants and herbs in an attempt to cause even more visions. They 
          believe that they have been chosen by the Wargod and are responsible 
          for trying to interpret the dreams and visions, both their own and those
