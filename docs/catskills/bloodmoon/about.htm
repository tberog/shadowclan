            <i>The power of the Wargod is growing. Not only has the strength and 
            numbers of the Orcs grown, but also their influence over humanity 
            is gaining. The Orcs now have power to cause insanity. It appears 
            after some social contact with Orcs some humans are corrupted. These 
            weak-willed humans have been known to babble in the orcish language. 
            They are also tricked by Orcs into many evil acts against their own 
            race. Orcs love to see humans fight humans. Orcs still do not trust 
            these insane humans but tolerate them for short periods of time. The 
            Wargod influences these insane humans to further his cause which makes 
            the ShadowClan stronger. As the ShadowClan grows so to does the Wargod's 
            influence over the common humans that populate the land... <font color="#CC9966">&quot;</font></i></font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The BloodMoon Tribe, 
          one of the first, was formed by the Wise UnsGub in the early days of 
          the Clan. Orcs in this tribe tend to be fervently religious and devoted 
          to the Wargod. This religious mindset makes them more introspective 
          than most orcs. Having a certain calm, inner peace is important to them, 
          and they will often go on pilgrimages or make sacrafices when they feel 
          this peace is disturbed. This calmness is evident in battle, where they 
          will cooly engage the enemy, hacking at them with a strange gleam in 
          their eyes while chanting prayers and devotions to the Wargod.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> The BloodMoon 
          Tribe is a group of zealot Orcs banding together and motivated to carry 
          out the Wargod’s will and spread his message. When converting, they 
          will either succeed or die. It is all the same to a "moonie".</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> The BloodMoon 
          tribe firmly believes that all power springs from the heart, and thus 
          they tend to collect hearts of all kinds, epecially their own. Some 
          will even drink blood from a fresh victim. Right and wrong are not as 
          important as the Wargod's will. They follow the Wargod and his orders 
          blindly and stop at nothing to get the job done. Accidents will be attributed 
          to the Will of the Wargod.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> BloodMoon also 
          place more value in their beliefs than in their own life which can make 
          them very dangerous. Moonies consider themselves to be close to the 
          Wargod and hence superior to others. They disregard all others' opinions 
          as the Wargod is the only one capable of valid reasoning. This Wargod 
          pride often leads them to be greedy, arrogant, intolerant and egocentric. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">The Power of the 
          Wargod continues to grow and the Bloodmoon tribe can be found eagerly 
          collecting tribute for the Wargod. Another of BloodMoon's missions is 
          to spread the Wargod Insanity plague to all Orcs and non-orcs. Orcs 
          have been blessed with the power of Insanity. Every non-believer should 
          be given the opportunity to hear about the Wargod and become a Convert. 
          Human conversion involves death of the human flesh so the spirit can 
          visit the Wargod and be given Orcish flesh. Non-believers should be 
          clomped so their spirit can visit the Wargod personally where the Wargod's 
          direct influence can attempt another Conversion. Repeat attempts at 
          conversion with some stubborn unbelievers is not unheard of. Sometime 
          the spirit is still human in the Orcish flesh and clomping of gruntees 
          is not unheard of. Any time a gruntee is clomped for such a reason, 
          he should be informed that he might rejoice in the cleansing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> The Wargod talks 
          to many and is hard to interrpate. The reception and interpretation 
          of the Wargod’s plans are currently left up to the Mojoka, Nobs and 
          occassional enlightened Orc. When the Wargod needs action BloodMoon 
          will do it. BloodMoon following the Wargod’s directions will acquire 
          objects of power or clomp the Wargod's enemies. A BloodMooner prides 
          himself at being the best Luskr, Wompr, kultr, zultr, and Ligzr in the 
          Clan. </font></p>
