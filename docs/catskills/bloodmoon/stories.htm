            <i>The power of the Wargod is growing. Not only has the strength and 
            numbers of the Orcs grown, but also their influence over humanity 
            is gaining. The Orcs now have power to cause insanity. It appears 
            after some social contact with Orcs some humans are corrupted. These 
            weak-willed humans have been known to babble in the orcish language. 
            They are also tricked by Orcs into many evil acts against their own 
            race. Orcs love to see humans fight humans. Orcs still do not trust 
            these insane humans but tolerate them for short periods of time. The 
            Wargod influences these insane humans to further his cause which makes 
            the ShadowClan stronger. As the ShadowClan grows so too does the Wargod's 
            influence over the common humans that populate the land... <font color="#CC9966">&quot;</font></i></font></p>

          Aspirations - Puguzg'zalu</font></b></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Grey suddenly covered 
          the ground in a wave of light... All color and sound eventually being 
          consumed. <br>
          Puguzg'zalu looked down as the grey figures raced away from the corpse. 
          Sudden understanding filled him as he identified it as his own.<br>
          "Okay.. So I just find a healer" Pug had fallen numerous times before, 
          but he could never get use to the feeling... or perhaps more correctly 
          said, lack of feeling. He searched mindlessly looking for one of the 
          Wargods disciples to ressurect him. A figure could be seen in the trees, 
          so he raced toward it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> The sound and 
          color returned to him, as he materialized into a solid form. Pug sat 
          up, and gave the orb linked to his necklace a quick lick, which gave 
          him a feeling of magical refreshment, taking away the pain.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "Arrgg....Damn 
          Head Biters.. That's it... I've had it with those tools of ignorance 
          and laziness."<br>
          It only took a blink of an eye to return back to the fort, but this 
          time.. he was prepared.<br>
          His constant mixing of various ingrediants had given him the knowledge 
          of many potions and elixirs.. but he really only used one. This potion 
          was not for him though.. it was for his enemies.. . The potions swirling 
          with purple and yellow particles in it were tightly stuffed into his 
          robe, leaving barely enough room for himself to even be in it.<br>
          As Pug walked into the fort he noticed a group of Head Biters standing 
          on the ramp, and he calmly walked infront of their discussions to address 
          them.<br>
          "What do you want? Foolish Mage!" The group of orcs laughed together 
          as if something truely hilarious was said.<br>
          "I have come to prey for you, so good times may come to the orcs" He 
          wasn't lieing... He thought he was doing the Shadowclan a favor in the 
          destruction of this tribe of mislead orcs.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "Why do we need 
          -you- to prey for us?" A lanky, spear holding Head Biter asked.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "Because without 
          the Lord, you are lost...."<br>
          A look of anger filled all of the orcs gathered around the ramp to the 
          elevated hut. Pug could see this.. and quickly let loose a religous 
          chant of sacrifice.<br>
          "Hoowah Lord of Darkness,<br>
          Take these deaths as our apologies to you,<br>
          The clan is the water, and you are the river,<br>
          Hooowah.... Hoooowah!!!"<br>
          The orcs had nearly reached him with their birage of spears and axes, 
          but they were to late. <br>
          Pug clutched his orb and spouted the words of power "Port Ort Grav".</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> The shock of lightening 
          filled his body and proceeded to the endless power of exploding potions 
          surounding himself....and then there was darkness.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "Follow the path 
          of blood my child...<br>
          only then will you get to your true ability.<br>
          Devotion is the key, not stupidity.."<br>
          The coarse voice whispered in Pug's dreams..<br>
          "Wake up my disciple, you will have your time... but not yet..."<br>
          Pug opened his eyes suddenly and looked up at the aged Nob staring down 
          at him.<br>
          "Sorry about that mage, they didn't listen to me."<br>
          "I will remmember it..." Pug whispered quietly and gathered his health.<br>
          "Is this a vision from the Lord Of Darkness? Has he pledged me great 
          power in the future?"<br>
          Pug's thoughts raced through the rest of the night, but he know he would 
          never know.. until his time came. </font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>Ignorance</b><br>
          "Drink mighty Pug! Show us your great power!" The humans chanted over 
          and over. Pug quickly downed the jugs of cider as he listened to the 
          numerous praises being shouted at him by the humans.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "Lineup humies!" 
          came a booming voice from behind the wobbling Pug. Zatush'faugh took 
          a step confidently in front of the humans as they scattered chaotically 
          trying to line up. "Orcs hungry! Git Orcs fuud agh wool at bah bah pens!" 
          he commanded.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> The humans stood 
          dumbfounded. "What did it say?"<br>
          Pug thrusted his staff up in the air screaming to the humans, noticing 
          their confusion, "Diz wai! Follow da mite ub pug tu git fuud!" He marched 
          in front of the humans and led them ignorantly.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "There is food!" 
          said one of the humans behind him. He eagerly looked and saw at the 
          corner of his eye that he was now partially surrounded by the humans. 
          Pug hurled his orb of power over their heads and magically appeared 
          under it, catching it as it fell. As he caught the ball a firm blow 
          to the back from a war hammer sent him forward. Only being met by the 
          sharp blade of a kryss pushing through his abdomen.<br>
          "Arrrgh!" Pug cried out in pain as he slowly slid from the blade, falling 
          to the ground.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "Take the ball 
          and let's get out of here!"<br>
          A human quickly snatched the magical orb from Pug's relaxed grasp and 
          followed the other humans into a gate.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> <b>Pain</b><br>
          Staring into the sky motionless, the world seeming to move slowly. <br>
          "Pug!?" screamed the gruntee Hav'grim on her way to his rescue.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> Hav'grim strained 
          as she picked him up to take him to the orc fort.<br>
          As she entered there were only a few orcs in the fort. The rest of the 
          clan obviously in pursuit of the attackers. Hav'grim quickly searched 
          the fort for a proper place to let Pug recuperate. She sat him down 
          on a bedroll next to the fort's anvil.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> For some reason 
          there was a deep longing for him to grip his magical orb, but to his 
          shock he found that it was not in his arms. A cry of anger attempted 
          to escape his lips, but was only audible as a deep wheezing sound. He 
          knew there would be much trouble for him if he did not find it soon.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> Pug pushed up 
          on his staff, attempted to struggle to his feet, only to be forced back 
          down by the young Zult-R. Pug gripped the staff even tighter as he sneered 
          at Hav'grim, forcefully pushing to his feet. He felt alone without his 
          magical orb, and he set out to find it.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> The vast woods 
          surrounding the fort were usually easily navigable for Pug. Everything 
          seemed so different to him though. The trees were taller, and seemed 
          to weave back and forth to taunt him. Pug wheezed in anger as he shook 
          a fist at the lively forest. He searched through the forest, trying 
          to find his way to the one place he knew would be safe from the trees. 
          The house had stood up to the great power of the forest for ages. He 
          turned left as he saw a grave sticking out of the ground. Exhausted 
          and angry Pug kneeled before the stone. Scraping his fingers lightly 
          over the carving in the stone.<br>
          "ZugRak, crayzee mojoka" read the stone.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> " I am here" Pug 
          thought as he forced himself back to his feet.<br>
          He passed several trees and a worn hut was unhidden by the forest. Pug 
          continued to the worn home of past mojokas. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b>Sacrifice</b><br>
          "Where is lat..where is lat?" Pug rocked back and forth in the stone 
          chair within the battered walls. He reached to the air as if he could 
          suddenly bring back the only object that had previously helped him control 
          his powers. A loud noise erupted from behind Pug as he rocked back and 
          forth. Three other orcs had entered the room, slamming the door behind 
          them.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "Me hab sumfin 
          for lat. It am sumfin dat Gu'clomp teached me long ago" exclaimed Gi'mar, 
          reaching around in his robe searching for something. "Mmhm..yub...mmhm..."<br>
          The other two mojokas, which had entered the room with him, stared at 
          Gi'mar as he spoke with his magical bunny. The bunny made a final nod 
          to Gi'mar and quickly jumped straight onto Pug, crawling into his robe. 
          </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">"Lat beddur gib 
          him back, or me will be gone for good!" Suddenly Pug felt the bunny 
          twitching and pushing against his body, and Gi'mar erupted into flames, 
          falling to the ground.<br>
          "Whoa!" The mojokas gasped, following the lump crawling in Pug's robes 
          with their eyes.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><b><b><font color="#CC9966"><a name="lud1"></a>Of 
          Arrows - Lud'rak</font></b></b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Visionary. This 
          is how Lud'rak might describe it, in a single word too big and round 
          for her thin mouth to contain. Smoke spirals wafting from an orcish 
          firepit, the sky dim in its sunset of pale orange and touches of yellow. 
          Dark red-orange highlights of trees without leaves swaying against the 
          dominance of the wind, looking as if the limbs might snap from the rebellion 
          of force.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> Below her, at 
          the edge of the descending ramp, there stood five orcish gruntees--Yggdrazil 
          the Ligz'r, Zagrukh the Kigg'r, Zeht'baal the Kigg'r, Wuz'Rug the Zult'r, 
          and Zuljin the Kigg'r. Some were aged wiser than the others, Zagrukh 
          having only recently come into the world, still slick from his rise 
          from the uzg and the belly of his birthing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "Whu ere tinkz 
          dem deztined tu be ogh da uldezt Tribe, da strungezt in da weyz ogh 
          Shakh Buurz, da Bluud Muuniez?" Lud'rak lifted her chin and proposed 
          the question to the small gathering, as a heathen of orc skin shifted 
          noisily in the wooden pen, and the firelight dimmed and gradually dissipated 
          to red embers and ash. For too long, there was silence, uneasy in the 
          air that smelled of rotting onions and burnt human hair.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> There was one 
          who raised his paw, a zult'r. Lud'rak grinned and arched an eyebrow 
          while assessing the rest of the gathering. Many of them were unsure 
          of which Tribes they belonged to, but this zult'r seemed rather convinced 
          that he knew his path, even as young as he was. Lud'rak knew the same 
          feeling, something warm and dark in the very pit of her stomach, expelling 
          itself from her throat with every word she murmured in the name of Shakh 
          Buurz. This was her way, her fate, and she was pleased to see it in 
          another orc.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "Wull den, sinze 
          sum ogh lat du nub gruk whut lat want tu be ash muun," although granted 
          Lud'rak was looking as one gruntee fanatic about the fire god of the 
          Ghaashies, she continued on with her words, "Me gib lat ash chanze tu 
          blah wit Wargod." And in that moment, her eyes closed, and she whispered 
          a prayer so heated on her tongue that it made her teeth click and her 
          jaw clenched tight.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> The glide of her 
          arms eased the bow forward, and she prepared for the strike. Across 
          her hips rested a satchel bound with leather strips at the sides, and 
          in this, she carried her arrows. Five arrows were removed, one for each 
          gruntee, and she held them by her strong, knicked fingers. The five 
          arrows were shot at once. Each one slammed into the gruntees, hard and 
          fowl with the intent to do great harm.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> Lud'rak's eyes 
          opened, and she saw which orc was chosen from the few. While one single 
          arrow was lodged into the chest of Wuz'Rug, piercing beyond his ringmail 
          armor and into his flesh, the other four were left with arrows in their 
          thighs or feet. Wuz'Rug gasped, but remained strong, as Lud'rak took 
          the time to step down the ramp and harshly pull the bloody-tipped arrow 
          from his wounded skin.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "Whut am lat, 
          den, Wuz'Rug the zult'r?" Lud'rak's eyes narrowed for a second, as she 
          was curious in what ways Wargod would speak to her in acknowledging 
          the one she knew she much teach the methods of Blood Moon to. He was 
          of a bloodline from other lands, and because of this, Lud'rak was admittedly 
          suspicious of any trickery that might come into play by his kind. Clever 
          as she was, she sought to never be deceived.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "Prophit!" Wuz'Rug 
          cried it out with such confidence that Lud'rak was stunned. She stepped 
          back and eyed up the others, who were greatly anxious for bootcamp. 
          Oh, and what an interesting night it would be, for a first time of running 
          bootcamp, and a first chance at teaching what being a Prophet of Shakh 
          Buurz wholly meant to the entirety of the Clan to one zult'r.</font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Hav'grim woke up 
          that morning, she had had a frightening dream. Orcs stood over the bodies 
          of slain humans. The bodies covered the ground stacked upon eachother 
          they were so numerous. The stench was rancid and the smoke from Ghaash 
          clogged the air and burned the eyes. But the blood red moon glowed so 
          brightly it could be seen through the veil of smoke that hung in the 
          air like a death shroud.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> The orcs were 
          jubulant, but suddenly the tension began to build. Hav'grim watched 
          in horror as the orcs began to bicker over who was stronger and who 
          was better. They becan to squabble over trophies they wanted from the 
          numerous corpses. Within moments they began to turn into cows and attack 
          each other. Mooing plaintively, they struck at themselves and eachother 
          with hoves and horns. With a a gasp Hav'grim sat up in a cold sweat. 
          She rushed from her tent and found the first orc in need. Vikk'Deruk.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "Du Lat gruk de

          "Huw du lat gruk,Hav, wut Trugulu wunt?" </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Hav'grim turned 
          to the Heckler and proclaimed ferociously. "Hav gruks bekuz her Muunie! 
          Agh muunie am de kluzezd twibe tu de Skahk'buurz! Uz hez chuzen urkz! 
          Cee de tru paff Vikk!" Hav'grim shouted passionately.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "Urh?" Was Vikk's 
          only reply.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "DEN MAT AGH BLAH 
          WYF HEM LATSELB!" Hav'grim screamed and in a flash she clomped the disallusioned 
          orc. The Skahk'buurz must have had a lot to speak with him about for 
          it took the orc a long ime to return with new flesh. While he was gone 
          Smyt'baal confronted the Zult-r.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> "Hav ef Humie 
          luut hem me clomp lat." the tribeless could only sneer. "Ef humie tef 
          fing frum Vik ed am weyll ub Skahk'buurz agh nub fer uz tu kweshun. 
          De Skahk'buurz wurk en miztereuz weiz." As surely as the sun rises the 
          human stole an article from Vikk in a moment the orcs attacked but he 
          escaped not before Hav'grim chased him herself half-way through Shame 
          pass. She returned to the fort and after several moment of defending 
          the fact the the Skahk'buurz had a reason for the looting of Vikk the 
          human returned and attacked the preaching orc. within moments the human 
          was Krimped and killed. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2">Vikk's looted item 
          was returned to him and more items were added to the hungry Gratch boxes 
          stomach. "Cee me blah lat su." The proud bloodmoon campaigned, grinning 
          as she pointed to the undoubtable influence of the Skahk'buurz plans 
          before them. There could be no doubt. </font></p>
