            <i>The power of the Wargod is growing. Not only has the strength and 
            numbers of the Orcs grown, but also their influence over humanity 
            is gaining. The Orcs now have power to cause insanity. It appears 
            after some social contact with Orcs some humans are corrupted. These 
            weak-willed humans have been known to babble in the orcish language. 
            They are also tricked by Orcs into many evil acts against their own 
            race. Orcs love to see humans fight humans. Orcs still do not trust 
            these insane humans but tolerate them for short periods of time. The 
            Wargod influences these insane humans to further his cause which makes 
            the ShadowClan stronger. As the ShadowClan grows so to does the Wargod's 
            influence over the common humans that populate the land... <font color="#CC9966">&quot;</font></i></font></p>

          a Convert</font></b></b><br>
          First decide if Blood Moon fits your character's overall current personality. 
          By the ideals of Blood Moon orcs, you do not choose what Tribe you belong 
          to, it is your destiny. By having this attitude and treating your orc 
          character as though he/she is meant to be Blood Moon, you will find 
          immediate responses from higher ranks seeking out Blood Moon potentials. 
          Other ideas on how to establish yourself as a role playing oriented 
          orc are listed below.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><font color="#CC9966">Blood 
          Tome:</font> This is your orc's own personal writing about his/her experience 
          following Shakh Buurz, along with discoveries or quests. Some refer 
          to it as an equivalent of an orc bible. It is something that Blood Moon 
          orcs generally keep within their Tribe, since it is very sacred to them. 
          These are generally written in "newborn" books, so that they always 
          remain with you. If you have left yours behind, ask a Blood Moon member 
          if they can help you get one.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"><font color="#CC9966">Sacrifices:</font> 
          Offer sacrifices to Shakh Buurz any chance you get. Bring animals to 
          the fort and have massive slaughters and prayers. Whenever you kill 
          something, make the body bleed onto the ground. Remember that Blood 
          Moon orcs believe that the more blood is spilled into the earth, the 
          stronger Shakh Buurz will become, until the end day arrives and the 
          Wargod rises. Eat the hearts of heathens, for it will renew your strength 
          in battle.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> <font color="#CC9966">Castes:</font> 
          If you plan to be quite ahead of yourself, you should look into what 
          Caste you would like your character to be in the future. These are meant 
          to be suited to your character's behaviors. For example, an orc who 
          prefers to dwell in the dreary forests of Yew bringing about visions 
          through days of hunger would be better suited to the Prophet role than 
          to the Martyr role. Figure out stories that will reflect your character's 
          active part in a particular Caste.</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> <b><b><font color="#CC9966">Life 
          as a Convert</font></b></b><br>
          </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="2"> Although 
          your character is still Tribeless, you have the benefit of being acknowledged 
          as a Blood Moon hopeful through your title. It means you have achieved 
          the first step in becoming Tribed and devoting yourself to a Caste. 
          Continue to stress role playing above all. Feel free to preach if your 
          character is a Preacher, and charge ahead clomping if your character 
          is a Martyr. Work on developing your character through activity around 
          the fort and the posting of stories.</font></p>
