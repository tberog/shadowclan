a Peaceful Visit to the Orc Fort</font></font>

<br>
<br><font color="#FFCC00"><font size=+1>Do what ever an orc tells you to
do. Doesn't matter if its a gruntee fresh from the womb. If not, you had
better leave fast.
<br>
<br>NEVER loot a corpse that has fallen
at the fort. If a fight happens, hide, run, or recall out.&nbsp; Orc fights
are not your fights, no matter how good a friend you are.

<br><br>Never enter the fort without a
Grunt or higher ranked Orc's permission.&nbsp; Usually tribute will get
you in, depending on your intentions.

<br><br>If you show up at the fort and
ask for entrance, it is a good idea to appear non-hostile.&nbsp; Removing
of your weapon and helm are appropriate measures.&nbsp; Also leave your
steed outside of the fort.&nbsp; Orcs love horse meat.

<br><br>Never at any time play clompgame
with an orc of any rank.&nbsp; Nobs won't ask you, grunts know better,
and the pee-brained gruntee's will learn quickly.&nbsp; If you play a clompgame
with one orc, you play it with all of them.

<br><br>Do not participate in combat at
the fort unless an orc nob requests aid.

<br><br>Roleplay! The orcs are doing it,
you better do it. Bring a tribute to their Wargod. This should grant you
safe passage through orc lands.

<br><br>Bad idea to summon a daemon or
polymorph into one. This is the form of their wargod and they will interpret
your action as mocking them.

<br><br>Don't flame on the clan message
board.&nbsp; Post a respectable message, and they will respond.&nbsp; If
you have a problem with another orc, tell a Nob.&nbsp; Nobs can be reconized
by their body sash. The best way to complain is to send a nob an icq message.

<br><br>Don't go spamming the fort. At
best, you will be put on ignore. That's not the way to handle it. Use some
common sense.&nbsp; Keep in mind, they are orcs.</font></font>
