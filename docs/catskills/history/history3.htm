<p><b>Blakbluds</b></p>
<p><i>The Blakblud Rebellionsaccording to ScumGlug, BlakBlud Nob and Thrak-Ghaash

<p><b>The First Blakblud Rebellion:</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Various members from several different tribes decided that they didn't like 
	the way things were going in the Shadowclan (specifically, friendly relations 
	with some humies and humie guilds, and the Undead) and decided to leave their 
	own tribes and form a new tribe with the goal of bringing the orcs back to 
	their roots. </p>
  <p>Zug'Zuul, the Hedbiter nob, was joined by gug'gug, ScumGlug, Ka'Cal, and 
	quite a few other clanmembers (mainly from the Hedbiter Tribe) to form the 
	Blakbluds. </p>
  <p>The Blakblud tribe grew and prospered, attracting quite a few new members, 
	and doing well in the Warboss clomps. Zug'Zuul went to join the WarGod and 
	ScumGlug, Ka'Cal, and Kil'rogg were eventually promoted as nobs of the Blakblud 
	tribe. </p>

<p><b>The Second Blakblud Rebellion:</b>
<blockquote>
  <p>Five or so Drinkie Fests after the creation and rise of the Blakbluds, there 
	came the infamous Warboss Clomp where Glug Ughurk, the Howler candidate was 
	healed by a Dark Dwarf named Grim Stormcloud during the combat. There was 
	a huge outcry, and the Blakbluds demanded that the Warboss Clomp be re-fought.&nbsp; 
	The rest of the tribes were willing to forget the stuntie interference, as 
	it mattered little in the overall outcome and let Glug keep the title. </p>
  <p>The Blakbluds were not willing to allow the Warboss to keep his new office 
	without a rematch. When the Clan returned to the fort, the Blakbluds refused 
	to follow his orders, and when the rest of the clan tried to force them, they 
	fought.&nbsp; Over the next couple of days, as it became obvious that the 
	rest of the clan was willing to keep Glug as Warboss, the Blakbluds declared 
	their own candidate, N'Grulk, to be the Warboss, and the Blakblud Rebellion 
	was in full swing. </p>
  <p>For several days, the Blakbluds took on the entire Clan.&nbsp;Tribal conflicts 
	are not uncommon, and this was especially true for BlakBluds as they often 
	fought with the Howlers and Moonies, but this one became something different..&nbsp; 
	Having had enough of the fighting (and losing, because the Blakbluds were 
	severely outnumbered), gug'gug unilaterally decided (without consulting the 
	other Blakblud nobs at all) to split the Blakbluds from the clan. Because 
	of the strict hierarchy in the Blakbluds and the oaths of loyalty, the other 
	Blakbluds were forced to follow. </p>
  <p>gug'gug moved his tribe to the caves in the Shame Pass and declared many 
	new and strange rules for his Blakblud clan. Many of the other Blakbluds disagreed 
	with this development, including the two other Nobs in the tribe, ScumGlug 
	and Ka'Cal.&nbsp; Many exiled Blakbluds chose one of two paths - they left 
	the Blakbluds and rejoined the Shadowclan as tribeless, or they remained Blakbluds 
	but went to sleep, hoping that things would get better and they could re-awaken 
	and return. </p>
  <p>For a week or so, gug'gug tried to lead his clan-in-exile, and then he disappeared. 
	After another week or so of gug'gug being gone, ScumGlug stepped forward, 
	claimed that gug'gug had died, and that ScumGlug had received a revelation 
	from the Wargod - he was to form a new tribe, the Thrak-Ghaash, from the remains 
	of the Blakbluds. </p>
  <p>Most of the exiled Blakbluds (that had not already returned as tribeless) 
	followed ScumGlug back into the Clan as this new tribe.&nbsp; The next Warboss 
	clomp (won by the Moonie, Grishnak)&nbsp; was a day or two after that. The 
	Thrak-Ghaash participated, but didn't have enough eligible warriors to fill 
	out a full team.</p>
