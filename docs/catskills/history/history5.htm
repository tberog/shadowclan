<p>&nbsp;
<p><i>The Blud'ghaash Cycle according to Gromas, Blood Moon Nob</i> 
<blockquote>
  <p>As all good orcs and many terrified human villagers know, the Shadowclan 
	is made up of several tribes. Sometimes it is useful, though not quite perfectly 
	accurate, to think of the Howling Skulls as wolf-riding generals, the Hedbiters 
	as human-hating drunkards, the Bloodmoon as arrogant zealots, the Thrak-Ghaash 
	as crazy fire cultists, the Throquats as far wanderers and the Shrinkhu as 
	collectors.</p>
  <p>Prior to the emergence of the Clan as a force to be reckoned with, the tribes 
	each wandered the world warring with each other and with the lands of Man. 
	Thus it was that the Lands of Man trembled when the Elder Nobs forged the 
	great alliance that came to be known as Shadowclan. </p>
  <p>However, things were not all peace and prosperity for the orcs. One could 
	say, their greatest enemy would always remain themselves, for inevitably their 
	expansion would be checked by infighting and bickering. A strong leader could 
	unite them, but often intertribal politics would tear them down before they 
	conquered the world. </p>
  <p>When Thrak-Ghaash appeared on the scene, many considered them to be weird 
	upstarts. Chief among their enemies was the Bloodmoon tribe...the first tribe 
	of Shadowclan and for a long time the only religious one. They saw Thrak-Ghaash 
	as rivals for the Wargod's affection, and it grated on them considerably that 
	the Ghaashies worshipped fire, and not blood. </p>
  <p>There came a day when the Dread Nob himself challenged the ancient Gaashie 
	Nob G'haarg to a battle of words over which element, blood or fire, was the 
	greatest. This came to be known as &quot;The Great Debate&quot; and ended 
	when the two came upon a lone Howling Skull wandering the forest. </p>
  <p>&quot;Ah!&quot; Spake the Dread Nob Gromas, &quot;Here we have a grunt of 
	the Howling Skulls...let us forgo our great debate and challenge him to give 
	proper answer!&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;Indeed,&quot; agreed the horrible G'Haarg, &quot;Let us ask him which 
	is greater and see how he answers!&quot; </p>
  <p>The Howling Skull came at the Nobs bidding, for all grunts obey Nobs, who 
	are both holy and mystical no matter their tribe of origin. </p>
  <p>&quot;Which is greater? Blood or Ghaash?&quot; asked the Dread Nob Gromas. 
  </p>
  <p>The grunt looked at the Bloodmoon Nob and responded, &quot;Neither.&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>&quot;Oh ho!&quot; exclaimed G'Haarg, &quot;Are you sure about that?&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>This was troubling. Now the Ghaashie Nob was asking the same question...and 
	the Howling Skull grunt was put in a quandry. </p>
  <p>&quot;Yub,&quot; quoth he, &quot;Howlers best.&quot; </p>
  <p>&quot;Is that so?&quot; Inquired Gromas archly, &quot;Is that so?!&quot; 
  </p>
  <p>And on it went with the Howling Skull going back and forth and the two Nobs 
	working themselves up to a frenzy of epic proportions. Predictably, this ended 
	in the grunts death at the hands of the Bloodmoon Nob and the Thrak-Ghaash 
	Nob. </p>
  <p>When the two Nobs looked up from their handiwork at each other...each thought 
	the same thought. </p>
  <p>&quot;Together we are stronger, and the great argument can wait.&quot; </p>
  <p>It has long been discussed whether those two Nobs more evil than they were 
	insane. But that they were crafty old Nobs could not be questioned. The two 
	put their heads together and came up with a plan to win the Warboss clomp 
	that cycle...and share it between the two of them. </p>
  <p>From time immemorial, the ambition of the Howling Skulls tribe had stood 
	in opposition to the scheming of the Bloodmoon tribe. The insult of the murdering 
	of the grunt had to be addressed, and the threat of a Bloodmoon/Thrak-Ghaash 
	alliance had to be challenged. Other tribes saw the threat as well, especially 
	when the plan of G'Haarg and Gromas came to fruition, and a Warboss cycle 
	was shared between two tribes...a thing that had happened never before in 
	Shadowclan history. </p>
  <p>With a war cry of &quot;Foul!&quot; and &quot;Unprecedented!&quot; and &quot;Unconventional!&quot; 
	and &quot;Heretical!&quot; the tribes gathered support against the Moonies 
	and the Ghaashies. After that shared cycle, the Thrak-Ghaash tribe was able 
	to win the Warboss clomp over and over again, much to the dismay of the Bloodmoon 
	tribe which began to rethink its involvement in the so-called &quot;Bloodghaash 
	alliance&quot;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>One year later:</u>&nbsp; The Thrak-Ghaash and Bloodmoon tribes were planning 
  a one year anniversary celebration of the Blud'Ghaash cycle.&nbsp; The Moonies 
  and Ghaashies were lined up in the fort preparing to go off to the Blud'ghaash 
  fest.&nbsp; Morgul, in his first cycle as Warboss, led a charge of Hedbiters 
  and Throquats that came into the fort and slaughtered the Moonies and Ghaashies 
  as they were preparing to celebrate the alliance (though it has been noted that 
  Morgul did not plan the attack)&nbsp; The subsequent day, two Kultrs dressed 
  as Shrinku makrs assasinated Morgul in the tent behind the fort.</p>
