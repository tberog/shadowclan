  the Great Lakes Shard</font></p>
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <p>Uguaguc and Ugruk founded the Shadowclan on the Great Lakes shard at the 
	beginning of Sosarian history (SC Yearr1,(<i> Late 1997</i>)). The small band 
	of orcs who lived on that shard made their home in a tent in a clearing just 
	to the south of the Graveyard between Cove and Vesper. The orcs who lived 
	there would make toll-stops on the road to the north, and visited much of 
	that world. Some even hoped to reclaim the Cove Orc Fort, long inhabited by 
	an aggressive Clan. There were many conflicts with humans as well, and among 
	the their favorite tactics was using the "Fireball" spell (which at that time 
	was a incredibly powerful spell in the worlds) on the nearly non-existent 
	Shadowclan.&nbsp; The Elder Nobs Uguaguc and Ugruk provided the guiding vision 
	as Shadowclan grew and developed. They participated in any such discussions 
	on the Clans direction and though open to new ideas they kept ultimate veto 
	power if a change was proposed that wouldn't fit the Clan concept. They left 
	the day to day running of the clan to the Nobs.&nbsp; <br>
	<br>
	It was a very hard life for these early pioneer orcs. All of their worldly 
	possessions were stored in a single chest or carried by the orcs themselves. 
	But what little they had they shared with their fellow orcs.</p>

	Some of the orcs known to have been early members of the Shadowclan living 
	on the Great Lakes shard were: Uguaguc, Ugruk, DigDug, Unsgub, ZugRak, Rah'Ghash, 
	Shagrat, Kargrath, Greesh, Ghash, and possibly others. The tribal stones did 
	not exist at that time, so it is nearly impossible to determine any more of 
	their names. And even if they did, surely the ravages of time would have wiped 
	them clean. Whatever we know from those moons must be passed down to us by 
	the great orcs that lived them. <br>
	<br>
	Several of these orcs have passed on to us how UnsGub was their only Nob, 
	and that tribes were never established in the before-world. All of the Great 
	Lakes orcs wore boots in a brownish shade, and had the use of many weapons, 
	since bludlines were unknown in those savage and desperate moons. The ritual 
	of Warboss challenges was not yet codified, and it was simply a matter of 
	challenging the current Warboss whenever the challenger felt like it. The 
	Warboss had the honor of wearing a cape and speak in the dialect of his own 
	choosing. Challenges were always one-on-one affairs, and probably occurred 
	with little to no ceremony. Orcs known to have been Warboss there are: Ugruk, 
	Urkbug, and ZugRak. <br>
	<br>
  One oddity of the Great Lakes world were strange hummies, who often helped the 
  Clan . Hummie help was sometimes grudgingly allowed as the Clan numbers were 
  not sufficient to defend themselves against all the evils of that world (<i>pictured 
  is a hummie slave who would sometimes bring great feasts to the Clan</i>). The 
  Shadowclan was small, and the Wargod was distracted by the many non-believer 
  Shardies, so he did not notice them at the time. They called to him for help, 
  but he only gave them a small amount - allowing them to return to flesh when 
  they died, but taking from them some of their talents and strength for his own 
  use. 
  <p>Little else is known of these early days of the Shadowcan on the Great Lakes 
	Shard. Most of that information was swept from their souls by the Wargod when 
	these orcs transferred worlds.</p>
  <p> Encouraged by ZugRak, the huge mass of unfriendly "humies", as well as the 
	great thickening of the atmosphere on that world, the orcs of the Shadowclan 
	determined to leave the only home they had ever known, and venture through 
	the void to a new place known as the "Catskills Shard". Assisted by the Wargod 
	through the channeling power of ZugRak, the orcs performed an inter-dimensional 
	migration. The exact date of this transference is unrecorded to history, but 
	is seems to have occurred around the time of the human's "December" moon. 
	The orcs sacrificed their old bodies to the Wargod and began anew, with shiny 
	skin and sharp, new weapons to "clomp" the humies with. Uguaguc, Ugruk, DigDug, 
	ZugRak, Kargrath, Greesh, and Rah'Ghash successfully made the trip, and they 
	were soon joined by Azog, Grith'Nith, Gnish'Kor, Gi'Puz, T'berog, Orkik, Yug, 
	Delaz, Ghash, and many other orcs who would lead the Clan to greatness.</p>
