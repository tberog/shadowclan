  Amongst the Clan 
  <center>
  </center>
  </font>
<p align="center">&nbsp;
<p>In the beginning the clan had very little in the way of official religion. 
  Some say it didn't exist at all, until much later. The first record of a ritual 
  to the Wargod was Zugrak, the Clan Mojoka, placing bones, hearts, livers, and 
  other objects of power, in patterns around the fort. Chanting mystical words, 
  Zugrak would turn into the Guise of the Wargod and speak with His Voice. The 
  orcs in the fort would supplicate themselves in praise of him and his power. 
  Later, the Wargod took over Zugrak’s mind, driving him to madness. He ran around 
  the fort bashing his head into things, drooling and babbling nonsensical words. 
  The Wargod would transform his body, speaking briefly through the dessicated 
  form of the ancient Mojoka, delivering his messages to his subjects. At that 
  time, many considered the Wargod to be little more an extremely powerful demon.<br>
  <br>
  The Bloodmoon tribe was the first truly religious group of orcs in the clan, 
  and they formed one of the original tribes. The Bloodmoon tribe was first developed 
  by Unsgub, declaring the Wargod as the supreme power and the only true guidance 
  for the Clan. Bloodmoon orcs tend to be extremely zealous. The Bloodmoon orcs 
  are also responsible for much of the Clan's mythology and growth of religion. 
  Many hummies shudder when they hear that a Moonie has been declared Warboss, 
  fot they know that such an event soon hearlds the arrival of fanatical orcs 
  in their lands, eager to send them to meet the Wargod. The Bloodmoon tribe believes 
  that all power springs from the heart, and so they often collect the hearts 
  of their victims and kin alike. The Bloodmoon tribe also believes that the Wargod’s 
  true form is that of a powerful demon. Some Moonies, such as Tug'mog and M'thorg 
  PigStick, would poison themselves in the fort and babble and chant things to 
  the Wargod until they died and journeyed to the Wargod Shine, gaining new flesh 
  and purifying their spirits. Many religious orcs have made that trip. About 
  a year after the founding of the tribe, Yug, first Namahk, coined the term Shakh 
  Buurz, or Dark Lord, bestowing a new title upon the Wargod.<br>
  <br>
  This leads to the next big religious enlightenment, which was the formation 
  of the original Namahks. This was Yug's attempt to bring the religion to the 
  entire clan, and not only the Bloodmoon tribe. On January 24th, Yug made the 
  original Namahk guide, including many chants and ceremonies most of which are 
  still in use now. The three original Namahks were Yug, Oblok, and Orkik. One 
  their first day together they sacrificed many animals and that night was the 
  famous attack from Da Boyz where the Wargod smiled upon the orcs and caused 
  a ripple in time that allowed the orcs to be prepared for the attack the second 
  time around. All of the hummies were slain and their flesh eaten by the victorious 
  and jubilant Clan.. 
<p><b>Story of the Formation of the Mahks </b>(From Mahk page)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Long ago during the darkest days of the clan, when wave after wave of humans 
	would beat down on the fort and savage orcs with only helm and axe would throw 
	themselves on the attackers, the war god, looked down upon the fort and spoke 
	to a Bloodmoon grunt by the name of Yug.</p>
  <p>&quot;<i>YUG! LAT IZ WEAK. DESE BUUBS AGH FUUD TINGS LAT SAKRIFICE TU MEEZ, 
	WELL . . . DEM GUD, AGH DE PRAYURS IZ FINE, BUT SHARA BLUD YUG, DAT IZ WAT 
	LATS NEDS TU GIB.</i>&quot; Yug cowered.</p>
  <p>&quot;How me du dis? Yug clomps de humies. Me gits de tribute. Iz Yug nub 
	gibin enuf blud? Nub gruk how tu gib mur.&quot; The War God roared.</p>
  <p>&quot;<i>DID MEEZ ASK FER LATS TU BLAH?? LUUK... DIS IZ DE BLUD ME WAAN!!</i>&quot; 
	A image formed in Yug's mind. It was a human leading a huge army of tin covered 
	warriors. Yug had been killed numerous times by this army and knew them well. 
	A single thought entered his mind.</p>
  <p>Me nub kin du dis. Lobster an dem boyz, dem clomp meez tu easi. Yug tuu weak. 
	Another roar erupted and Yug found himself flying across a vast distance again</p>
  <p>&quot;<i>DUMASH ORK! LATS TUNG WIL NUB WERK NOW AGH LAT KEEP DE BRAIN TINKING 
	ON FUD. NUB QUESHUN DE WAR GOD!!! ME GIB LAT MISSHUN, FIND UDERS WIT DE SAME 
	TAUTS AZ LAT. PRAYS TU MEEZ, GIB DE BLUD OV DE WEAK HUMIES AGH WARGOD WIL 
	LEED LATS CLAN TU DE MOSS GLURIUS VIKTURY LAT HAB EBUR SEEN. TREW DETH AGH 
	DISASTUR AGH DE BLUD OV DE CLAN, LATS WIL OBTAIN DE CONKWEST BUT ONLEE IF 
	LATS TRULY SAKRIFICES.</i>&quot; With that Yug found himself back in the fort. 
	Quickly he tracked down those that shared his beliefs. The original triad 
	of Namahks was founded. Oblok , Orkik and Yug donned the sacrificial aprons 
	and on the night of their creation sacrificed Bears, deer, and a single human 
	to the War God. When they had finished an unusual calm settled over the fort. 
	Jovial and hard drinking orcs fell back and paced with furrowed brows. Nobs 
	moved away from the front of the fort and consulted with the various Mojoka 
	that were around. Yug felt an itch on the back of his neck and as he turned 
	around he caught the distinct shimmer of a blue door forming near the pig 
	pen. Out from it poured human after human led by the one Yug had seen in his 
	vision. Orc after orc was ruthlessly cut down, some more than once right in 
	front of an uncomprehending healer that continued to work to the War Gods 
	instructions. All armor and weapons were stripped from the bodies and eventually 
	the fort was silent again except for the droves of orcish ghosts that lingered 
	there.&quot;Iz dis de sakrifice lat wanned?&quot; Yug asked before blacking 
	out.</p>
  <p>When he came to Yug found himself surrounded by Oblok and Orkik again. They 
	looked around the fort, at the fully armed orcish warriors and then Yug realized 
	the War Gods plan. Quickly large crates were contructed and scattered all 
	over the fort and orcs crowded in where the hole had opened. There were some 
	that didn't think the humans would be stupid enough to try their attack again 
	but Yug knew. The hole opened again, and unable to move, scores of humans 
	were slain. Lobster's own head was hoisted high in the fort before being secreted 
	in Digdug's personal box of heads. From this one event Yug finally understood 
	his purpose and long after Orkik and Oblok returned to the War God side, Yug 
	continued to refine and improve on the will of WarGod</p></blockquote>
  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the Mahks, the next notable event in the Clan's religious history, came 
  with the formation of the Thrak-ghaash tribe, a second tribe that worships a 
  different view of the Wargod (Ghaashakh or Fire Lord). ScumGlug was responsible 
  for the formation of this new tribe, which was made after the downfall of the 
  BlakBluds. The Thrak-ghaash believe that the Wargod’s true form is the Fire 
  Elemental. This is a very different view from that of the Bloodmoon tribe, and 
  has led to several conflicts between the two. With the founding of the second 
  religious tribe, the power of the Wargod grew and his favour was upon the Clan.<br>
</p>
<p>As the Clan grew, the Mahks heard from the Wargod about Urucku.&nbsp; Urucku 
  would be an orcish system of virtues that would help the Bludlines better follow 
  the WarGod's desires. See the Shadowclan <a href="http://www.shadowclan.cx/UO/CS/urucku.htm"><b><i>urucku</i></b></a> 
  page for more info.</p>
<p>Each tribe has it's own beliefs in how they should do the Wargods bidding.&nbsp; 
  In fact the Wargod has many names that tribes call him:&nbsp; Shakbuurz (Dark 
  Lord) to the Moonies, Ghaashak (Fire Lord) to the Thrak-Ghaash tribe, Uzgoth 
  (Land Master) to the Throquats and Trug'ulu (Wargod in old speech), but all 
  serve him in their own way.&nbsp;One belief is that once orcs have proved themselves 
  worthy to the Wargod a portal called &quot;the blakrok&quot; will open up and 
  the Wargod will come forth and strike down all unbelievers in his path in an 
  event called the Orkorok.</p>

  Known Religious Artifacts:</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<b>Digdug's olig</b>:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>During Digdug's time as Warboss, it is said he possessed a crossbow blessed 
    by the WarGod of incredible power.&nbsp; This crossbow was&nbsp; known to 
    have killed enemies of the Clan with one bolt.&nbsp; This Olig was surely 
    blessed by the WarGod, but seems it was lost to the ages.</p>

<p>-<b>Shakh Buurz Ghaash Drum</b> 
<blockquote> 
  <p>The story of the Ghaash Drum:<br>
    <br>
    A human named Eric the Red learned of the existence and the fabled War Drum 
    of Fire and made a long and arduous search for its location. He finally found 
    it on the Ice island, held by a guild led by a human known as 'spammy'. He 
    passed the information along to the Clan and Yug immediately knew from the 
    description that this could be none other than the Ghaash Drum, mystical drum 
    of the Wargod. This sacred artifact had been long possessed by a rival clan 
    of orcs who inhabited the Cove Orc Fort but had been lost when they were overrun 
    by an army of hummies. It was high time that the Drum rested with its rightful 
    owners, the Shadowclan! </p>
  <p>With help from Glug Ughurk (the current Warboss at the time) Yug formed a 
    war party and enlisted the help of the mojoka so that they could visit the 
    island and parley with the humans, for the drum was kept deep inside a forboding 
    fortress whose locks could not be broken. After some negotiation and trading 
    of gold and jewels the drum was passed over to the Clan in a brief ceremony. 
    The orcs returned home victorious and much celebration ensued. The Drum was 
    kept by Yug for a bit then placed on a vendor-slave so that all could pass 
    by and view it. It was then loaned to Scumglug and Smugruk for a Thrak-Ghaash 
    ceremony and eventually put on another vendor-slave who died in a mysterious 
    accident leaving the Drum on the ground for who knows how long. But the Wargod 
    smiled on the orcs, for Smugruk happened to notice it and recovered the Drum 
    before hummies could steal it. Then came the Great Challenge. Both the Moonies 
    and the Ghaashies claimed the Drum was theirs by right. The Moonies challenged 
    the Thrak-Ghaash for its possession and a glorious battle was fought at the 
    Undead Keep in which the Bloodmoon Orcs emerged victorious and re-gained control 
    of the Drum. </p>
  <p>For the longest time, the Drum was stashed in secret hiding places to keep 
    it safe and eventually, placed in the Orcpost. Lamentably, the Orcpost collapsed 
    during an earthquake one fateful day and the Ghaash Drum was lost. Though 
    it has since been recovered, stories vary on how it re-appeared. The most 
    common tale is that of Gi'mar receiving a vision from the Wargod, leading 
    the Horde into a deep cavern beneath the earth and finding the Drum amongst 
    the treasure trove of an Ancient Wyvern. Others whisper that the Drum had 
    been stolen by an unscrupulous human who kept it locked away in the hummie 
    town of Britain, out of the reach of the Clan, and that the Nobs were forced 
    to negotiate a ransom for its return. Whatever the truth may be, the Drum 
    is now safely in the hands of the Clan again, and kept safe until a time comes 
    where its powers are needed again.<br>

-<b>Kab'lar, Holy orc book</b> 
<blockquote>
  <p>The Kab'lar is the book telling of the creation of the first orc, Yawek, 
	and of his journeys. The kab'lar is the used by the Mahks to preach the word 
	of the wargod. The Mahks have learned the ancient speech, the language the 
	book is written in, only Mahks and nobs have the skills to understand the 
	book. There are rumors of other books, or other parts of the Kab'lar, but 
	none of them have been discovered yet. The book was found on the Third level 
	of Covetous, were Yawek currently resides inside the solid walls of the dungeon.</p>
  <p>Another portion of the Kab'lar - the &quot;<i>Sut'yer</i>&quot; was given 
	to Morgul in covetous by a sharkuu orc named Narguthra.&nbsp; It is written 
	entirely in the ancient speech and G'Haarg the Namahk and Morgul are hard 
	at work trying to decipher it's meaning.</p>
