<p align="center"><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">The Bludlines</font> 
<p>
<p>Though tribes are the first and foremost 
  badge of honor among the orcs, the Bludlines are almost equally as important. 
  Every orc takes pride in their profession and it is not unknown for fights and 
  quarrels to develop between the different Bludlines over which one is better!</p>
<p>Originally, there were only three Bludlines; Lusk'r, Womp'r and Mojoka (the 
  A-sas-uns are not spoken of). Ligz'rs were considered to be weak, and though 
  most orcs did pick up a bow from time to time, it was often used for hunting 
  rather than fighting. It was only after archery became viable in of its own 
  that it was promoted to its own Bludline and those who used it as well as melee 
  were forced to choose between them. Actually caused some friction within the 
  clan. Kar'grula was the main promoter of the Kiggr Bludline and became the first 
  Blud'K'igg-r when the Bludline was made official. The Zult'r Bludline was added 
  even later, after Eerg and Wog joined the Clan.</p>
<p>Rankings within the Bludlines were originally decided through simple trial 
  by combat. Each combat would be one on one and was overseen by a Nob or Blud'leader. 
  Since the emergence and development of Uruckru, ranking by combat has been dissolved 
  and each Bludline has their own tests and rituals for those who wish to rise 
  to the Gu', Ug' and Wa' ranks.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><i>Note: Obviously much of the information 
  regarding Bludlines is incomplete. This is due to the fact that many of the 
  Bludlines consider their history and rituals sacred and never share the details 
  with those outside of their Line.</i></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><b>Lusk'r lore:</b></u></p>
<p>One of the original Bludlines and probably the most popular of them all throughout 
  Shadowclan history.
<p>Story of the <i>Kihagh</i>: G'Haarg and Thr'gash was sitting inside the nob 
  hut drinking and chatting when T'Berog entered with a puzzled face and claimed 
  he had heard strange sounds in the ruins close to the ruins east of the road. 
  He had not felt uncomfortably with it and had a strange feeling that the Wargod 
  wanted a Lusk-r to investigate it. So Thr'gash was sent and came back a little 
  later speaking of Kihagh and bloodlust. This was the beginning of Uruckru.
<p>Yawek was the first orc according to orcish legend. Naturally he was a Lusk-r. 
  His lusk was made from a Yew tree and the blade fashioned from a piece of meteorite. 
  He resides within a wall in the holy library in the depths of Covetous. Frug'kog 
  and Kuz'grak, Thrak-Ghaash Mahks, were the ones that found out that he could 
  be conveyed with through the wall if a smal, appropriate ritual was performed. 
  He was the one who gave the orcs the holy book of Kab'lar. 
<p style="margin-bottom: 0">The first Lusk'r Warboss was Digdug of the Bloodmoon Tribe.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0"><u><b>Womp'r lore:</b></u></p>
<p>One of the original Bludlines. Proud of their heritage (two of the three original 
  tribe Nobs were Womp'rs), Womp'rs are known for their strength and have always 
  played an important part in Clan battles, both against the enemy and in the 
  Warboss Challenge.</p>
<p>According to legend, the tunnels of Shame were dug by the first Womp'rs.&nbsp;The 
  Womp'r shrine is said to contain the bodies of those that dug them.</p>
<p>First Wompr warboss was Gor'bladz of the Howlers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><u><b><a href="history_mojokas.htm">Mojoka Lore:</a></b></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12"><u><b>Ligz'r lore:</b></u></p>
<p>Kargrath and Digdug fought in the first warboss clomp.&nbsp; At that time there 
  was only one contestant per tribe&nbsp; (and only two tribes - Bloodmoon and 
  Howlers). Both used a lusk in the fight, but interestingly enough Kargrath was 
  primarily a Ligz'r and Digdug was also known for the use of a magic heavy crossbow.&nbsp; 
  Digdug won and ended up the first warboss. Soon after, Kargrath became the first 
  Ligz'r nob.&nbsp; Kargrath was the Nob that the shardee king officially turned 
  the orc fort over to.&nbsp; Also, he was known to shout &quot;Kargrath neber 
  dies&quot;&nbsp; which is in use by Ligzr's today.</p>
<p>A little known orc by the name of Snar'grak was actually the very first Blud'Ligz'r, 
  but he dissappeared soon afterwards, and the position was given over to
Ug'Chugrat 
  who went on to become a well-known part of the Clan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0"><u><b>Kigg'r lore:</b></u></p>
<p>The K'igg was shunned by most orcs in the early days of the Clan. Though several 
  orcs tried them out at times, it was Kar'grula, a fierce Fe-orc from the Howler 
  tribe that was the true champion of the K'iggr cause. She carried hers proudly 
  at all times and would proclaim its value for all to hear. Eventually, the Nobs 
  recognized the validity of the K'igg and promoted it to a full Bludline and 
  appointed Kar'grula as first Blud'kiggr. She later one became the first Kigg'r 
  Nob.</p>
<p>First Kiggr Warboss was Jir'ye of the Throquats.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><u><b>Mak'r lore:</b></u></p>
<p>In the early days, many orcs took up tradeskills, for it was vital to help 
  re-equip the Clan after battles. Only after the Clan became stronger and well-established 
  did the Mak'r Bludline emerge. These were orcs who were dedicated to the making 
  of thingies for the Clan. Though some of them could fight, that was not their 
  primary purpose. Normally, this would have been considered a unacceptable weakness, 
  but as the Clan's power grew, so did its ability to protect the ever-valuable 
  Mak'rs. These days, Makr's are a common sight around the fort, often banging 
  on the anvil in the corner of the fort or sitting quietly by the fire sewing 
  leather. They are also generally the ones in charge of organizing and preparing 
  the the monthly Drinkee Fests.</p>
<p>J'lok Z'lok was named the first Head Mak'r when the Bludline was made official.</p>
<p>Gi'Mar began a museum dedicated to collecting the artifacts created by clan
mak'rs.&nbsp; The museum continues on to this day, and bears the name &quot;Gi'Mar's
Mak-R Museum&quot; in honor of its founder.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><u><b>Zult'r lore:</b></u></p>
<p>E'erg and Wog were brothers and also the first two zultrs.&nbsp; To decide 
  the first Blud'zultr they went to the desert south of the lighthouse in the 
  new lands and fought.&nbsp; E'erg won and was named the first leader of the 
  new Zult'r Bludline.&nbsp; Ja'rak and Wog were made Wa'Zult-rs the same day. After Eer'g left, the Blud'zult-r 
  was left open, because Ja and Wog were still looking for Eer'g,&nbsp; they shared 
  duties on running the line, as Wa's. As far as Ja'rak is concerned, Eer'g will 
  always be Blud'zult-r, so don't try and tell him different.</p>
<p>First Zultr Warboss was Xug'gug of the Srinkhu.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><u><b>Bludline Leaders:</b></u></p>
<p>Bludline leaders are responsible for watching over gruntee and tribeless
members of their bludline.&nbsp; Overseeing Urucku development and running clomp
ranks also are their duties.&nbsp; Much confusion exists over the clans first
blud leaders but a rough listing is shown below.</p>
