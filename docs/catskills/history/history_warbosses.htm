<a NAME="1,2">
<u>1,2. DigDug - Muunie Lusk-R <br></u>
</a>
Obviously his claim to fame is he is the first Warboss of the Shadowclan.  Probably most reknowned because he is the answer to one of the most commonly asked boot camp questions.  "Whu wuz da first warbozz?"
<p>
He was a quiet yet forceful leader who led by example rather then by rhetoric. [Gi'mar]
<p>
He is also the first Warboss of the Blood Moon tribe.
<p>&nbsp;

<p>
<a NAME="3">
<u>3. Glug Ughurk - Howler Lusk-R <br></u>
</a>
One famous story of an early Warboss is that of the "Gruntee Warboss". Only a Gruntee when the moon set that morning, Glug Ughurk, was blooded a Grunt in the Howling Skulls Tribe on the same day as the Drinkie Fest. Other Howlers bluded that moon included KarGrula, Na Zul, and Urgrubuk. Suprisingly, Glug was made their Warboss Candidate! Whether this was from a lack of Lusk-rs and Womp-rs (the K'igg-r bloodline was very new at that time) is not known. Though little chance was given for him to win, win he did, and Glug Ughurk became known as the "Gruntee Warboss". [Yak'barz]
<p>
Everyone knows that Glug Ughurk was the gruntee warboss, but what isn't commonly known is that his first victory nearly destroyed the clan.  The Shadowclan was only a few months old, remember.  Digdug was the only warboss anyone had ever known.  The idea that every month we would have a new one wasn't exactly very formal.  When Glug Ughurk won, there were a lot of people who viewed it almost as a hostile coup.  [Gor'bladz]
<p>
Many orcs and other people flatly refused to recognize him as the new warboss and would not follow him.  People were actually quitting over it.  Digdug took the extraordinary step of making several posts telling people Glug was a nice guy and all this was fine with him, and that people should give him a chance.  The very first change in adminstration in Shadowclan was far from smooth. [Gor'bladz]
<p>
Glug Ughurk is also the first Howler warboss in Clan history.
<p>&nbsp;

<p>
<a NAME="4">
<u>4. Grith'Nith - Howler Kult-R/Lusk-R <br></u>
</a>
Grith'nith was a kultr, however noone was aware of this fact at the time.  He was dressed as a luskr and noone questioned his bludline as kultrs are not allowed in the fest.
<p>&nbsp;

<a NAME="5">
<u>5. Yug - Muunie Lusk-R <br></u>

<p>&nbsp;

<p>
<a NAME="6">
<u>6. Glug Ughurk - Howler Lusk-R <br></u>
</a>
This was the second reign of Glug Ughurk.  This was the Fest when the Dark Dwarf interfered with the Warboss Clomp allowing Glug to become warboss.  N'Grulk and the Blakbluds felt betrayed as they would have won that fest and would have had their first reign with N'Grulk as Warboss.  You could say it was something of the first Warboss war with Glug having the backing of the Howlers and the Moonies, and the N'Grulk having the Backing of the Blakbluds and the Throquats, as both wore a cape and sash.

<p>
<a NAME="7">
<u>7. Grishnak - Muunie Lusk-R <br></u>
</a>
A historicaly significant event during Grishnak's reign was the so called Towers Battles, or Two Towers Campaign.  It is notable primarily due to it being one of the first real post rep patch attempts at running some sort of organized campaign style event.  It barely even got off the ground before problems canceled it, but in a lot of ways the lessons learned from it lead directly to the more successful Yew War that followed.
[Gor'bladz]
<p>&nbsp;

<p>
<a NAME="8">
<u>8. Gholam - Biter Lusk-R <br></u>
</a>
The first warboss of the Hed Biter tribe.  The sleepiest warboss ever.  He was never seen after his victory in the ring.
[Gi'mar]
<p>&nbsp;

<p>
<a NAME="9">
<u>9. Jir'ye - Quattie Kigg-R <br></u>
</a>
The first warboss of the Throquat'uzg tribe.  She is also the first non-Lusk-R warboss, she is a Kigg-r.  And after saying that, she is the first Kigg-R boss.  I believe she also holds the record for being the first fe-orc boss in Clan History, which there have been very few.
<p>
One thing that GGG might get more credit for than he deserves is the Yew Wars.  Jir'ye was actually the current Warboss when this event first started.  The Yew Wars took place for about half of her reign, and then half of GGG's reign.
[Gor'bladz]
<p>&nbsp;

<p>
<a NAME="10">
<u>10. GruntGlubGlub - Howler Lusk-R <br></u>
</a>
GruntGlubGlub (AKA GGG) led the orcs into battle in the famous Yew Wars. [Buurz'lusk]
<p>&nbsp;

<p>
<a NAME="11">
<u>11. Thulag'Agz - Ghaashie Lusk-R <br></u>
</a>
Thulag'Agz reign was notable for two things:
(1) The first great war between the Undead and the Shadowclan orcs, and (2) leading the assault and capture of the Ophidian Temple by Shadowclan.
[Thulag'Agz]
<p>&nbsp;

<p>
<a NAME="12">
<u>12. Ith'gau'ra - Quattie Lusk-R <br></u>
</a>
Ith'gau'ra was unfortunate enough to be warboss during the clan's trial period as a chaos guild.  as a result, many orcs were inactive during his reign, weakening the strength of the clan.
[Gor'bladz]
<p>&nbsp;

<p>
<a NAME="13">
<u>13. Vladtharg - Muunie Kigg-R <br></u>
</a>
Vladtharg was extremely unpopular as a warboss to the general public simply because he kicked everyone who looked at him crosseyed.  If he asked you a question and you didn't answer fast enough, he killed you.  He said line up and you got disconnected, he killed you.  If you said anything he didn't like, he killed you.  If he was bored, he would often just walk up to people and kill them.  [Gor'bladz]
<p>
He is probably one of the most hated orcs in all of Shadowclan.  He later created the Wahju Uruk Clan, which were a problem for some time.  The Wahju Clan has now faded, and all orcs that were formally Wahju are hated by all Shadowclan.  Lesson: Don't betray
Shadowclan.
<p>&nbsp;

<p>
<a NAME="14">
<u>14. Gor'bladz - Howler Womp-R <br></u>
</a>
He is the very first Womp-r Warboss in Shadowclan History.  Gor'bladz is also the oldest warboss to still be active in the clan today.
<p>
<a NAME="15">
<u>15. Warbosses War, Vlad M K, Buurz Q L, Rel B L, Gor H W <br></u>
</a>
Read Rel'Gall's account of the <i><a href="history4.htm">The Warbosses War</a>.</i>
<p>&nbsp;

<p>
<a NAME="16">
<u>16. Rel'gall - Biter Lusk-R <br></u>
</a>
Rel's reign came as a final resolution to the warbosses war the previous month.  IC, Rel always believed that the wargod showed to everyone who was the "right" side during the warbosses war with Rel winning the next fest.
<p>
That drinkie fest was more attended than any I can remember attending since, which created a great start for the first real Biter cycle.  Rel's warboss trip ended up being a horde of a good 40-60 orcs storming the GoL tavern and slaughtering every last person there.  A second larger wave of GoL'ies was also annihilated when they attempted to take back the tavern.  The third wave finally broke apart the orcish invasion, but not without immense losses that day for the GoL.  
<p>
Perhaps the most influential portion of Rel's reign was bringing the GoL into almost daily contact with the orcs.  GoL had always been around, and occassional raids were done back and forth, perhaps once a week, but inbetween slaughtering the celts at their farms, the orcs and GoL warred for virtually the entire month.  At the time, the orcs were strong enough to triumph many times, even against a guild as large and powerful as GoL.
<p>
Rel remembers his reign as perhaps the last month the clan seemed to be at full strength.  Within the next few months, scores of orcs left for SP as it opened up, and for many months afterwards the Cats clan seemed on the verge of falling apart, but they preserved to be stronger today than in anytime since the SP split.  [Rel'Gall, all paragraphs]
<p>&nbsp;

<p>
<a NAME="17">
<u>17. G'haarg - Ghaashie Womp-R <br></u>
</a>
Being a euro-orc, G'Haarg spent much of his time leading smaller raiding parties into the celtic neighbourhood on a more or less daily basis. Also the TFC suffered from the mighty ghaashie warboss. Constant sidekicks during the days of G'Haarg was Gaakh-mat, tribeless at the time, and the gruntee (at the time) ligz'r Qub'mugg. More memorable trips include the salvation of all orc forts known to man errr orc including a huge battle in the ice cavern in which an old wise orc was saved. This orc in turn prepared G'Haarg for the next trip. This time it was down into Covetous to seek answers. These revealed a desecration ceremony to be performed in Trinsic but the orcs where halted there. Also G'Haarg led the orcs the conquer buccaneer's den including fights with many red humies. Also G'Haarg did a few raids against Winterfell which was frequent in those days. Also G had had great fun as a gruntee doing barricades in Shame which was a popular doing during G's daily trips. Most notably of G's personality is probably his way of addressing a large crowd and his ability to peptalk an orcish horde.  [G'Haarg]
<p>&nbsp;

<p>
<a NAME="18">
<u>18. Grugluk - Quattie Kigg-R <br></u>
</a>
The second fe-orc Warboss in Clan History.  I remember this fest specifically because I think this one was what got me interested in Throquats.  I remember that one of her guards was Vro'nuk, one of the early Zult-rs in Shadowclan.  Her other guard was Buurz'lusk.  In time, Vro'grak quit and Gub'rail (Kigg-r) took his place as Grugluk's guard.
<p>
The Shadowclan Spotlight appeared on UO.com during Grugluk's reign, greatly increasing the number of gruntees in the fort. Grugluk spent quite a bit of time testing gruntees and adding them to her stone. Grugluk was also Blud'k'igg-r, rock boss and Diplo-orc while she was Warboss. Eventually Grugluk tired of all this work and not too long after her reign she began grooming a successor for the Blud position so she could retire to henpeck her lairmate, Thulag'azg (they are the only pair of Warbosses to have been lairmates).  [Grugluk]
<p>&nbsp;

<p>
<a NAME="19">
<u>19. Gromas - Muunie Lusk-R <br></u>
</a>
The Dread Cook Warboss!  At this time I believe Gromas was going by the title of Dread Cook, until later when he was made a nob and he is now the Dread Nob Gromas.
<p>
The eligibility of Gromas as warboss was highly disputed at the time, as he was not bloodranked (all warboss candidates needed to be bloodranked at the time).  Immediately after the fest, to avoid problems, Buurz'Lusk (then Blud'Lusk-r) took him to the Kihagh shrine, gave him some quick Kihagh quests, and promoted him to Gu.  [Buurz'lusk]
<p>
Also, Gromas led a siege on Trinsic, which lasted a good chunk of his reign.  For the month, Shadowclan's operations were held largely out of a guard tower to the north of Trinsic.  Many orcs refused to help in the siege, as the fort would be left undefended.  [Searching for author]

<p>
<a NAME="20">
<u>20. Buurz'Lusk - Quattie Lusk-R <br></u>
</a>
Five months after his struggle with the Warbosses War, Buurz'Lusk once again entered the ring to claim the Warboss title for his tribe.  Backed by Jir'ye and Grugluk, two of the toughest fe-orks in the clan, he gripped his lusk tightly and prepared for a bloody battle. Kihagh began to fill Buurz, more than he had ever felt.  The power was overwheling, and then.....darnkess.  Buurz woke up to find his two guards standing next to him and bodies from every tribe lying dead in the ring.
<p>
The main notable things about Buurz's reign:<br>
1)First Pir'ork warboss<br>
2)Was Blud'lusk-r when he became warboss (back then, blud's were allowed to compete in the clomps)
<p>
Buurz's ability to lead trips was cut short though, as he became the 3rd warboss in history (after Rel'gall and Grugluk) to become burned during his reign.  [Buurz'lusk, all paragraphs]

<u>26. Ul'gala'ka - Howler Womp-R <br></u>
</a>
Ul'Gala'Ka led the orcs during the Siege of Trinsic.  The Siege of Trinsic was an incredible event that lasted multiple days (2-3).  During the time directly prior to UO:Renaissance, OSI had undead minions attacking Trinsic.  It was during this time that Shadowclan also attacked Trinsic and clomped everything from undead to NPK's to oomies to GM controlled monsters.  It was a lot of fun.  We actually had a "fort" set up in town, it was more of like a base.  Orcs were supposed to log in and out there as if it was the fort for those days during the Siege.  We had many encounters with OG, Order of the Griffon, who were a pretty large group of do-gooder role-players that Shadowclan fought often.  It was a well-organized event and I'm glad I participated in it, all in all I would say hundreds of players from the RP'ing community particpated in this event.

</a>
N'Grulk had decided to leave the clan when G'Haarg tricked him into coming to the Fest under the pretence of being a moral booster.  When he arrived it was announced that he would be the Warboss candidate one more time.  Very unenthusiastically he got himself killed right off the bat, but thanks to the strength he had in his guards he managed to win and started his reign of warboss trips.  Twice a week for the four weeks of his reign he took as many orcs as he could muster on a trip to a dungeon or other hotspot, including Destard, the Ice Cave, and taking on the Shadow Rangers in the flower world.  N'Grulk felt that activity and continuous trips were considered a necessary moral booster for his warboss reign.  [N'Grulk]

<u>38. Zug'Dagh - Quattie Lusk-R <br></u>
</a>
Zug'Dagh won the Warboss Clomp as the representative for the Throquat Uzg Tribe in January 2001 in his second attempt to attain the rank of Warboss.  The guards were Gra'ook, later to be the Blud'Lusk-r, and Morgul, who later went out to be Warboss (and in a strange twist of fate, Zug was his guard during the Clomp!)  The battle was swift, with their combined lusks going through their foes with skill and precision.  Shakh Buurz blessed Zug'Dagh and prophesied that much humie blood would be spilled within the cycle.  
<p>
The Clan's first trip under Zug'Dagh was to Panzee Uzg Pew.  Glokkpod the Ekirh had fashioned a pack llama with many buum juuzes in an attempt to destroy the Abbey.  The Clan occupied a farm house to the south of the city, luring the humans away from the Abbey.  Many humans were slain.  Unfortunately, each human wave took out a few orcs.  Eventually the Shadowclan were outnumbered and succumbed to the humans, and the plan was foiled.  Zug'Dagh led several attacks on Pew in his cycle, each ending in success as the ground was littered with human corpses before the Orcs fell.  The raids on Trinsic were extremely successful, wiping out all enemies while sustaining minimal orc losses.  Non-humie trips included the Shame Hule and the Ophidian Plains.  
<p>
Zug'Dagh led the Shadowclan on a war against the Cove Orc Fort to destroy the heethun shardies.  After several hours of bloody fighting, the shardies were wiped out and their armada burnt down by the ghaash walls from Tala'ghaash (please see Piktures section, Cove Fort Trip).  Zug'Dagh was around the Fort all but a few days in his cycle, and did his best to help teach gruntees the ways of the Shadowclan.  [Zug'Dagh, all paragraphs]

Morgul had 2 successful trips to Yew that we won and where few orcs died. Morgul also made a trip before the last day of his reign to the Terethan keep and placed an axe as a marker and exclaimed the land as Shadowclan territory. Morgul also led the assault on the Moonies ad Ghaashies during their celebration of the Bludghaash alliance, though Morgul didn't plan it. The next day Morgul was asassinated.  [Morgul]
<p>
Morgul's cycle saw many attacks on the fort from the combined forces of the Knights of Justice (K*J) and the Purple Guardians of Honour (PGoH). One large counterattack with the dedies saw the burning of K*J's tower.

<p>
<u><a name="51">51. Da'Bou - Muunie Lusk-R</a> <br></u>
Da'Bou became Warboss on January 26th, 2002. Da'Bou has claimed his cycle as
&quot;Da'Bou's Heathen Clomping Cycle!&quot;
<p>
One of the more influential events during Da'bou's reign was the Clomping of Trinsic.  During this campaign, Shadowclan attacked Trinsic similarly to the previous Sieges of Trinsic.  A temporary fort-away-from-fort was set up outside town.  Shadowclan organized its attacked from there.  Several waves of orcs pummeled into the human ranks of soldiers and cavalry.  
<p>
Screaming "Heathens!" the Shadowclan waged war against the residents of Trinsic.  Rushing to defend the city were several human guilds.  Too many to name, in fact.  It seemed that human guilds were coming out of the wood-work.  At first, the orcs were struggling to see the dim light of victory in the distance.  Humans were all over the town, using they're mounts and enchanted equipment to divide and slay the orcish hordes.  But after several strategic revamps and reorganization the Shadowclan beat back the human alliance.
<p>
During the final encounter, which took place on a bridge not far from the Paladin shrine in the eastern portion of the city, the Shadowclan attacked in two forces.  One horde attacked, expectedly, the front of the human forces.  A second team secretly sneaked their way upon the shores east of the human forces.  Perhaps the windy beaches kept the stench of the horde from finding the human noses, but in any case, the humans fought the orcish horde in front of them, completely oblivious to their rear.
<p>
It did not take long for the second orcish horde to creep up behind the human lines and ambush them.  Some humans tried to run, some stood their ground and combatted to their death.  In the end, all of the city could hear but one thing, the victory cry of the orcish hordes.
<p>
HOOWAH!
<p>
As hated as it was feared, the scream of victory dug its trench inside each
human's dreams, turning pleasant thoughts of theater and dance balls into
nightmares of death and pillaging.

<u><a name="52">52. Grak'Shogum - Srinkhu Kigg-R</a> <br></u>
Grak became Warboss on March 3rd, 2002. Grak was the second Srinkhu Warboss in
Clan history.&nbsp; Grak led several trips to explore Ishener.&nbsp; The Ghaash
drum was found during this cycle.&nbsp; Opposing humie factions around
Winterfell bought orc help with cidur, then aroused the clan's ire by kidnapping
Grak for the final days of his
reign.&nbsp; During the warbosses' absence the Throquat Uzg and Thrak-Ghaash
tribes clashed.&nbsp; As a result of this the Howlurs disbanded their alliance
with the Biturs and Throquats.&nbsp; To achieve Grak's freedom, &quot;Grinduulskoot&quot; (Pug) had to be
clomped.&nbsp; However this was not achieved until after a new boss had been
named.
<p>&nbsp;
<p><u><a name="53">53. Wud'Gub - Ghaashie Womp-R</a> <br></u>
Wud became Warboss on March 30th, 2002. This was Wud's second reign.&nbsp;
During Wud's reign the Clan occupied Yew town and built forts from which the
clan clomped Juhkas, Chaos dragoons, and Humies alike.&nbsp; Many skirmishes
broke out with the undead during this cycle due to territorial claims.&nbsp; Wud lead a large
retaliatory occupation of Timberidge to repay the Sentinel's for their attacks on
orc lands.<p>&nbsp;<p><u><a name="54">54. Igla'Zuk -&nbsp; Howlur Lusk-R</a> <br></u>
Igla became Warboss on April 28th, 2002.&nbsp; Igla brought the Clan to aid the
Undead in their final battle against humie, pict, and elf armies in Jhelom.&nbsp;
Igla felt this helped reconcile some of the differences between Orcs and Undead
from the previous cycle.&nbsp; Plague beasts and Bog
monsters were beaten back from the fort.&nbsp; The final days of the cycle saw a
large raid at the crossroad tower north of Britan and an excellent defense of
the fort against a large attack of burnt pushdugs.
<p>&nbsp;
<p style="margin-bottom: 0"><u><a name="55">55. Blud'nuut Hosh -&nbsp; Shrinku Kigg-R</a> <br></u>
Blud became Warboss on May 27th, 2002.&nbsp; Blud'nuut became warboss in an
interesting twist of events.&nbsp; The Shrinku had been paid prior to the fest
to only clomp the Throquat candidate Gor'Blatz last of all.&nbsp; As the dust
cleared and combatants fell only Gor'Blatz, Blud'nuut, and Xug'gug (Blud's
guard) remained.&nbsp; Xug'gug fell then Blud defeated Gor.&nbsp; The Shrinku
tribe was paid in full for upholding their end of the deal, and also won the Warboss
position.<p>&nbsp;<p style="margin-bottom: 12"><a name="56"><u>56. Buu'skr -&nbsp;
Throquat'Uzg Kigg-R</u></a> <br>Buu became Warboss on July 7th, 2002.&nbsp; Buu dedicated his cycle to “Removing the
filth”.&nbsp; This  included confrontations with the Celts, the Byzantine, and many clashes with the Yew
Militia at the fort.&nbsp; Delays to the removal of filth occurred due to
squabbles between the Throquat'Uzg and Howling Skulls tribes.&nbsp; Once the
conflict wound down, Buu led many trips to claim dungeons and cleanse them of
their champions.<p>&nbsp;<p style="margin-bottom: 12"><a name="57"><u>57. Hitk'Lky -&nbsp;
Bloodmoon Kigg-R</u></a> <br>Hitk became Warboss on August 3rd, 2002.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hitk has
proclaimed&nbsp; an “Introspective Orc Army”, urging orcs to learn about
themselves and the orcs around them.&nbsp; Hitk's ascension to warboss was preceded
by a humorous Nob clomp in which Shag (Howler) and Stump'er (Moonie) battled
against each other toe to toe for an extremely long time, eventually Gromas
(Moonie) arrived and jumped in the ring armed only with a cleaver.&nbsp; Both
Stump'er and Gromas fell to Shag's axe, but by that time Buurz'Lusk (Quattie)
had entered the fray and felled Shag.<p style="margin-bottom: 12">During Hitk's cycle, the clan set about building a portal for the Wargod.  The orcs were guided by Yawek who instructed the orcs to gather components necessary for the portal.  The first week of the cycle the bludlines fulfilled their parts as follows:  Zult'rs had a fishing trip, Lusk'rs gathered wood, Ligz'rs scouted and killed humans on the outskirts of the fort, Womp'rs gathered ingots, Kigg'rs protected the fort and defending against an attack, Kult'rs devised plans to retrieve the crystal half but failed, Mak'rs prepared items for battle, and Mojokas researched blackrock.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The next week, each Tribe held trips to acquire their components. Fal'ua of Howling Skulls led a trip killing demons for their bones (strength to the bone). Kul'Gur of the Hedbiters led orcs into Khaldun to kill the ancient liches for their blackmoor remains (heart of darkness). Pitgurat of the Srinkhu summoned a blackrock juggernaught and orcs killed it for its power crystal (power of a juggernaught). Lud'rak of Blood Moon led a battle in which a royal human was slaughtered and her blood taken into a vial (blood of a king). Zatush'Faugh of the Thrak'Ghaash brought orcs on a hut burning trip to acquire dead wood (rebirth fire). Gor'blatz took orcs out to Serpent's Hold by way of boat to battle humans and take soil from their conquered land (conquering spirit).&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Amidst finding the components, the Sect of Mondain visited the fort with bountiful tribute brought by pack horses. The evil mages proposed a deal that they inform orcs where blackrock could be dug up and where to build the portal, and after orcs found enough blackrock, they would split the resources. The Warboss made the deal, and the orcs went deep into Khaldun to mine for blackrock near the Tentacles of the Harrower. Many orcs were killed, but the Mak'r H'Gaarg was protected and escaped with blackrock for building the portal.  After examining the blackrock, H'Gaarg led the clan's womp-r's to dig up the Wargod Furies: Snarf, Clog, and Faugh.<br>
<br>
Two weeks of battle commenced when humans discovered the sudden fervent activity of orcs and sought to end it. Both sides had many losses and many wins. Two nights before orcs set out to build the portal, the Sect of Mondain returned to the fort looking for their half of the blackrock. Orcs denied them, for they needed the blackrock for the portal, and the Sect mages were killed. Cipher the Bloodletter of the Sect of Mondain came to Nocturne of the Yew Militia seeking his services for revenge. She informed them of the portal's building location
in a set of ruins near the location of Zugrak's portal to these lands and the
original Shadowclan War tent.&nbsp; Dedicated to ending the strengthening of the orcish horde, Nocturne led his army and others to the portal's destination on the day of the orc Drinkie Fest. Many orcs were gathered collecting materials to reinforce a fort around the portal which H'Gaarg was forming from
blackrock.&nbsp; Defeated in battle, the humans were set back, but their leader Nocturne managed to escape.<br>
<br>
Orcs completed the building process and Lud'rak the Namahk set forth the components from each Tribe. After much prayer, the Wargod came into Sosaria and brought word with him of Orcnarok. From the portal's walls of blackrock, he smelted four sacred weapons, pieces of armor for the orcs who served well over the month, and armor for the Elders which he entrusted to the Warboss Hitk. The portal was moved to a safe location  to call forth the Wargod when orcs seek guidance next.

Yew Militia (No Doubt intended for use against the undead).<p style="margin-bottom: 12">&nbsp;<p style="margin-bottom: 12"><a name="61"><u>61.
Nubb'h'k -&nbsp; Ghaashie Womp-R</u></a> <br>Nubb became Warboss on November
30th,
2002.&nbsp; During his post fest speech, Nubb shouted that his cycle would not
be a Ghaashie cycle, but a cycle of unity, a cycle of Shadowclan. He pulled off
his boots, cape, and sash and dunked them all into a tub he had set out. When
the items were emerged, they were a dark grey shade which he stated was the
color of shadows.&nbsp; He then set the dyetub upon the ground and asked who
would join him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p style="margin-bottom: 12">The orcs all looked to
one another, not knowing what they should choose.&nbsp; Finally, everyone's eyes
set on Gor'bladz for approval.&nbsp; Gor raised his gaze up and considered each
and every orc. Most of all, he considered the warboss.&nbsp; Finally he
muttered, &quot;See me boots? Dem wuz gibben tu me by Kar'Gruula before most ub
lats were eben burn. Der culurs will neber be changed. Bud me will allow fer
lats tu blah in da accent ub da Warboss. Me will allow lats tu dye lats boots tu.
However, lats am allowed tu keep lats buuts tribe colored tu.&quot;<br>
<br>
Many orcs dyed their boots grey.&nbsp; After
the Warbosses speech, a humie attack set upon the fort which the orcs beat back.&nbsp;
Later that night conflict occured&nbsp; between orcs wearing their tribal
coloured boots and grey booted orcs.&nbsp; For a couple days afterwards many
orcs wore grey boots.&nbsp; However some nobs expressed disproval of their orcs
dying their tribal boots.&nbsp; Concerned about potential backlash, the following day the warboss decreed
that all orcs were to change their boot colours back to their tribal colours,
but that he would keep his cape and boots grey.<p style="margin-bottom: 12">In
the ensuing days, the Warboss lead orc attacks against Cove where they fought
Numereon and Militia troops.&nbsp; The first attack an undead mage cast a gate
behind the humies defences and the orcs slaughtered the humies
unmercifully.&nbsp; The next attack, the warboss led a party of orcs around the
wall in a boat to harry the defender's from the rear while the majority of the
combined orc and undead force attacked the gates.<p style="margin-bottom: 12">The
Warboss Nubb and the Nahmahk Lud'rak held an expedition to find gruntees near
Minoc Trammel.&nbsp; Following this, a large group of orcs attacked the Yew
Militia's home in Riverrun where first the Militia then the Fellowship of the
Holy Dragon, then the Numereon's were beaten back.&nbsp; Later that evening a
large humie force attacked the fort which the combined orc and undead forces
withstood.<p style="margin-bottom: 12">&nbsp;<p style="margin-bottom: 12"><a name="62"><u>62.

  intrigue and whispers in the shadows. Books written in black speech were scattered 
  around areas orcs tred, and a mysterious spectre visited the fort with words 
  of the Blood Usher, while orcs came flooding forth from caves and foreign lands. 
  Bootcamps returned as a regular practice as Shadowclan flourished. The fort 
  was often raided by humans, and the orcs took many trips to conquer Felucca 
  Yew and Felucca Britain and the burnt scum therein.<br>

<p><u><a name="75">75. Gug'lub -&nbsp; Blood Moon Womp-R</a></u> <br>
  Gug'lub continued his reign as Warboss on January 11, 2004.&nbsp; His cycle 
  started with an attack on the rebuilt Yew Abbey. The Yew Militia returned and 
  rallied the reforming Byzantines and Romans for the cause. In an unfortunate 
  defeat, the orcs regathered at the fort. Fort defense strengthened and became 
  a prominent need again as the forces of the good streamed attacks at the fort.

  <u><a name="76">76. Ig'Lug'Nu - Howling Skulls Kigg-R</a></u><br>
  Ig'Lug'Nu began his cycle as Warboss on February 6, 2004. Trips included many 
  ventures into the champion spawn lands. The Abyss was finally conquered during 
  his reign, but Lord Oaks and his faery kin remain undefeated.

<p><u><a name="77">77. Lozik - HedBiter Womp-R</a></u> <br>
  Lozik's cycle as Warboss began on March 6, 2004. Immediately, he set to planning 
  a week long series of raids on the Yew Militia. <br>
<p>&nbsp;
<p><u><a name="78">78. Rug'yula - Blood Moon Kigg-R</a></u> <br>
This warboss cycle began April 6, 2004.&nbsp; Rug'yula led small skirmishes to the new Skara Brae Community Center, which 
  sent waves of concern and attention throughout the Skara Brae town. The town 
  was on constant watch with a multitude of guards as events such as plays, meetings, 
  and trials flourished. The orcs kept mainly to their own territories, but for 
  occasional attacks on the Felucca enemies.

<p>Drinkee fests were held on May 4 &amp; 8, but no warboss was chosen.<br>
