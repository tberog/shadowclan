<P><i>The Warbosses War according to Rel'Gall, Hed Biter Nob. Revised slightly
  by Tala'ghaash.</i></P>
<p>The internal strife known as the &quot;WarBosses War&quot; lasted for 6 days, 
  starting at the Drinkie Fest of March 3rd, 1999 and ending on March 9th, after 
  a great battle in the fort. But lets start back at the beginning, at the Drinkie 
  fest.... 
<p><b>Episode 1 - The Drinkie Fest</b>
<p>The WarBoss clomp is about to begin. All candidates are ready Yub'glubb of 
  the Srinkhu, Vladtharg of the BloodMoon, Buurz'Lusk of the Throquats, Gor'bladz 
  of the Howling Skulls (defending his title), Rel'Gall of the HedBiters and Nub'eer 
  of the Thrak-Ghaash. The fight begins and blood flies. Orcs fall on the ground 
  one after the other, They are now only three, Girda, Rig'r and Vladtharg, then 
  Girda falls too, only two orcs remain...Vladtharg's K'igg is faster, and he 
  kills Rig'r. Vladtharg is given his red cape, and leads the Clan on a trip to 
  Wrong. Perhaps some failed to notice the Wargod did not bless Vladtharg, but 
  the Elders did not. 
<p><b>Episode 2 - The Call of the Elder</b>
<p>The Elder called all the Candidates from the WarBoss Clomp in the fort, and 
  all other orcs as well. He explained that the WarGod was not happy. It seemed 
  that there was a problem with Vladtharg being WarBoss. He was not Blud-ranked, 
  which was a requirement for all candidates. Many orcs complained that they could 
  not hear the Elder and his speech. The Elder then asked to the tribes if they 
  challenged Vlad’s claim of Warboss. All of the other tribes challenged his claim 
  and sent a candidate into the hut for a meeting. Vlad was asked if he wanted 
  to defend his title, but he couldn’t see how he could with all these orcs against 
  him. Feeling his title was wrongfully being stripped from him Vladtharg left 
  the fort leaving his cape and Kigg behind. K'tar took his place in the new WarBoss 
  clomp that the Elder was organizing. All other candidates were the same as the 
  original Challenge, except for the Thrak-Ghaash, where Nub'eer was replaced 
  by Girdalzung. The candidates were placed in the pigpen with their armor and 
  weapons, and they fought until death. The clomp started with all five orcs charging 
  Girda, killing him quickly, K’tar and Gor’bladz soon followed. The Brother Lusk-R’s 
  Rel’Gall and Buurz'Lusk took down Yub’glubb to make sure one of them one would 
  win, then Buurz quickly killed the much bloodied Rel. The Elder announced Buurz 
  to be the new WarBoss, but the WarGod was silent and did not appear to bless 
  the Clan’s new choice. 
<p><b>Episode 3 - The Early Battles</b>
<p>Buurz'Lusk was not supported as Warboss by all of the orcs. It appeared to 
  some that Vlad had been wrongly stripped of his title but not all orcs accepted 
  Vlad either, and two factions began to appear in the Clan; the followers of 
  Vladtharg, talking in Moonie speech, and the followers of Buurz'Lusk, talking 
  in Throquat speech. Animosity grew between the two factions, leading to skirmishes 
  and battles between, but neither side showed a real superiority. Many orcs chose 
  to remove their support of the WarBoss they followed, and started talking in 
  their tribe dialect, or in a neutral speech. It was at this time than Dubjug 
  made himself heard; rejecting the claims of the current WarBosses, he began 
  the preaching of a 'real' WarBoss, one backed by the strength of powerful tribes.... 
<p><b>Episode 4 - The Warbosses Alliance</b>
<p>After the speech of Dubjug, the two WarBosses Vladtharg and Buurz'Lusk felt
that it would be hard to resist the power of the Hedbiter tribe and their
allies, decided to forget their differences for a time, and allied themselves
against the 'rebels'. Swearing to not allow a rebel WarBoss to rule the clan,
they asked all orcs to change their speech to BloodMoon, Throquat, or Neutral
colors.
<p><b>Episode 5 - The Rise of the Rebels</b>
<p>Rel’Gall awoke late that muun to find himself being attacked by Rajah without 
  a word. The anger rose in him as the situation of the two Warbosses unfolded 
  in his mind. Charging out of the fort he ran into another Biter, Ug-gluug. He 
  thought that if there was any time to show the strength the Biters and their 
  allies had, now was the time, to crush the other two bosses and unite the clan 
  under a single boss. The pijins flew and the rebel army gathered at the guard 
  tower. The rebel army of orcs, seething with rage and bloodlust, flew into a 
  mojo-hole right into a meeting between Buurz and the Elder. Buurz was quickly 
  cut down and the army charged out of the hut, cutting down all members against 
  them, with few losses. Vlad heard of the attacks on Buurz’s faction, and quickly 
  came to the fort to take down the rebels. They charged the fort time after time, 
  each getting them no closer as they were turned back with heavy losses. Vlad 
  went down a number of times leading his army into the fray. During this time 
  Dubjug and Rel’Gall meet with the elder to discuss a new claim to the warboss 
  title. Rel’Gall claimed he only wanted the Clan to be united again, be it under 
  him or another, but no more orcs killing orcs. Dubjug appoints Rel as their 
  Warboss, while the rebels hold off the attacks of Vlad’s supporters. After an 
  unsuccessful attack by the Undead under Vlad’s banner, there comes a meeting 
  of the Clan leaders in the hut. 
<p><b>Episode 6 - The End of the War</b>
<p>Representatives from all tribes except the Moonies gather in the hut. Rel'Gall 
  was called in by Thrakat’Duump and asked a simple question. The tribes present 
  all agree to choose Gor’bladz as Warboss, will you support him? Rel immediately 
  takes off his sash and robe and hands them to GGG, they are dyed and handed 
  to Gor’bladz, who becomes the fourth WarBoss of the cycle, ending the terrible 
  civil war of the Shadowclan, known as the 'Warbosses War'</p>
<p><b>Episode 7 - The next cycle </b></p>
<p>Rel'Gall won the the next Drinkee Fest clomp and his reign came as a final 
  resolution to the Warbosses war the previous month. Rel always believed that 
  the Wargod showed to everyone who was the &quot;right&quot; side during the 
  Warbosses War.</p>
