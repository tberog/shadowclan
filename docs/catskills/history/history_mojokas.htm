<p align="left">It is uncertain what the names of all of the Shadowclan Warbosses 
  were during the Great Lakes time, but some have said that ZugRak, also held 
  this title. While that is open to dispute, it is undeniable that he was the 
  first Clan Mojoka. After leading the exodus to the Catskills world, ZugRak became 
  more and more distant and strange. At the time of the second Warboss Challenge, 
  ZugRak finally felt the effects of channeling so much of the Wargod's energy 
  for such a long time (including the transference of the tribe from the Great 
  Lakes to Catskills worlds) that his soul was crushed. Whether he went mad, just 
  wandered off and died in the wilderness, was taken by the Wargod, or lives to 
  this day, no orc knows for sure. It is one of the great mysteries of the early 
  moons of the Shadowclan that may never be answered. 
<p align="left">The next Clan Mojoka made his appearance in the Shadowclan early 
  in its history. His name was WaargBoom, and his influence on the next critical 
  period of the Clan's growth would be legendary. He was different than ZugRak, 
  in that he focused on transferring the power of the Wargod into powerful mojo 
  that inflicted much death and mayhem on the evil humies. During the next few 
  cycles (the Era of the P'kai) WaargBoom could often be found (if you looked 
  REAL closely) at his post near the main gate in the fort awaiting the attack 
  of the humies. Upon his appointment as a Nob in the Howler tribe, Waargboom 
  gave over the title of Clan Mojoka to Gu'Clomp. He served as a Nob, and performed 
  many of the same duties as before, until one moon, Waarg departed the world 
  to join Kargrath, and JagrUk in the eternal battle alongside the Wargod.</p>
<p>Gu'Clomp...the third Clan Mojoka, was also called the &quot;Necro-orc-cer&quot;, 
  for his studies of the dead and undead. He was a member of the Bloodmoon tribe 
  and one of his favorite rites involved throwing dragon livers at enemies. He 
  was also responsible for the raising from the dead of the former Prince Stark 
  of Winterfell and bonded his animated corpse in undead servitude. His legacy 
  can be seen by orcs today at the Necro hut north of the fort.&nbsp;Tombstone 
  memorials of famous past orcs can also be seen there. Some say that one day 
  Gu'Clomp will return and raise up the dead orcs from their graves and they will 
  all march in final battle against the hummies in the name of the Wargod.</p>
<p>Here's a quote from the Mojoka page regarding Gu'Clomp's passing:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>&quot;Dis ash Clomp'd Ka'Cal da Hedbitur Nob agh Shakh Buurz git bery
  mad. WARGOD say him takin Gu'Clomp tu gib him punishmunt.... Gu'Clomp wuz
  takin tu da WARGOD by sum ghostie hursee...mebee him be bak sum muun....til
  den him be remembur'd....&quot;</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doshahk, a mute Bloodmoon Mojoka, was the fourth Clan mojoka.</p>
<p>Gi'Mar, apprentice of Gu'Clomp, became Clan mojoka after a long vacancy for 
  the position.&nbsp;Stories have it that Gi'Mar allegedly stole the ear of Jasos 
  (Former leader of Guardians of Light) and used it in sorcerous rites.</p>

  <p><i>Pictured to the left is a virtual Who's Who of ancient mojokas from the 
	Clan (Waargboom, Gu'Clomp, Doshahk, Ver'nuk, Smug'ruk and an unidentified 
	mojokii)</i></p>
  <p>Ver'nuk, who became Nob of the Hedbiters.&nbsp; He was known for having the 
	&quot;evil eye&quot;.&nbsp; Jokes have been made about Ver'nuk urinating and 
	then reading the puddle. One of the few mojokas to join the Hedbiter Tribe</p>
  <p>Vok (G'Nunk's mojokii who became very briefly a Moonie mojoka) was the crippled 
	mojoka. He would limp around, cough up blood and stuff. He was also known 
	for casting jewels in the pigpen, and telling fortunes from the way they landed. 
	One tale talks of him giving a reading to the famous, fe-orc, Grugluk. He 
	was pointing at the gold nugget that was further away from the Tourmaline 
	than the star sapphire. He said it mean that Grugluk would begin to think 
	less about material things and focus on Iggju. A few weeks later Grugluk became 
	Blud'k'igg-r.</p>
  <p> Smug'ruk who became a Nob of the Thrak-Ghaash Orcs. Smug'ruk left for a 
	time after his marriage to Pict Eagle was frowned upon by the Clan.&nbsp;Smug'ruk 
	was originally a Blak Bluud orc. After they left, he was briefly a Throquat 
	before settling in to the Thrak-Ghaash tribe, and then leaving again to become 
	&quot;the buurz mojoka&quot;.</p>
  <p>Unmul'ronk, who was Blud'mojoka at one time, has a crippled leg which is 
	why you may see him riding a llama.</p>
  <p>Nag'dush, Srinkhu mojoka that could mix a mean potion, but couldn't cast 
	a gate to save his life.</p>
  <p>Grusha, fe-orc mojoka old as dirt and had no teeth who could only eat muffins.</p>
