<p> <img src="sc_cats_hist_dt1.jpg" width="372" height="311" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">A 
  tribe is a collection of orcs who have bonded together for personal, safety, 
  and political reasons. Tribes represent factions of the clan, usually accepting 
  orcs from all Bludlines. The tribes are led by Nobs, who are responsible for 
  their tribe members. Rivalries between Tribes can sometimes be intense and occasionally 
  much orc blood will be shed. However, if things get out of hand and start to 
  disrupt the Clan, the Elders may step in and put an end to the squabbling. Tribes 
  always declare temporary cease fires and work together as a Clan when the Warboss 
  is present or there is a threat of hummies. 
<p>There were three original tribes, Bloodmoon, Howling Skulls and Hebiters. The 
  Hedbiters had troubel staying active within Clan politics, as they were all 
  too drunk to pay attention to what was going on around them. So for the first 
  many months, the Howlers and the Moonies fought with each other for dominance 
  within the Clan. After the Blakblud incidents, the Clan was reluctant to let 
  new tribes form. But T'berog, Scumglug and Nub'hosh all proved themselves worthy 
  and founded the remaining three tribes.

<p><a NAME="Moonies"></a><b><i><u>Bloodmoons [Founded by UnsGub]</u></i></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <b></b>The BloodMoon Tribe was one of the first two formed in the early 
	days of the Clan. Orcs in this tribe tend to be fervently religious and devoted 
	to the WarGod. This religious mindset makes them more introspective than most 
	orcs. Having a certain calm, inner peace is important to them, and they often 
	go on pilgrimages or make sacrifices when they feel this peace is disturbed. 
	This calmness is also evident in battle, where they coolly engage the enemy, 
	hacking at them with a strange gleam in their eyes while chanting prayers 
	and devotions to the WarGod.<br>
	<br>
	The BloodMoon Tribe is a group of zealot orcs, bound together to carry out 
	the WarGod's will and motivated by the desire to spread his word. They have 
	been chosen by the WarGod and will do anything to force others to either follow 
	the WarGod or die if they resist him. A BloodMoon orcs (or "Moonies") can 
	spend a great deal of time preaching the WarGod's message to others and is 
	willing to die to force them to agree.<br>
	<br>
	The BloodMoon tribe firmly believes that all power springs from the heart, 
	and thus they tend to collect hearts of all kinds, especially their own. Some 
	will even drink blood from a fresh victim in their pursuit of this power.<br>
	<br>
	They never care about right or wrong - it is the WarGod's will. They never 
	stop to think how their actions may have consequences for others. They just 
	follow the WarGod and his orders blindly and never question his intent. Accidents 
	will be attributed to the Will of the WarGod. BloodMoon orcs also place more 
	value in their beliefs than on their own life which can make them very dangerous.<br>
	<br>
	Moonies consider themselves to be closer to the WarGod and hence, superior 
	to others, including other orcs. They disregard all others' opinions as the 
	WarGod is the only one capable of valid reasoning. This WarGod pride often 
	leads them to be greedy, arrogant, intolerant and egocentric.<br>
	<br>
	As the Power of the WarGod continues to grow, Bloodmoon orcs can often be 
	found eagerly collecting tribute for the WarGod. Another of the BloodMoon's 
	missions is to spread the WarGod "Insanity" plague to all other orcs and to 
	non-orcs. Orcs have been blessed with the power of "Insanity". Every non-believer 
	should be given the opportunity to hear about the WarGod and become a Convert. 
	Human conversion involves death of the human flesh so that the spirit can 
	visit the WarGod and be given Orcish flesh. Non-believers should be clomped 
	so their spirit can visit the WarGod personally where the WarGod's direct 
	influence can produce this conversion. Repeated attempts at conversion with 
	some stubborn unbelievers is not unheard of. Sometimes the spirit is still 
	human in the Orcish flesh and a repeated clomping of a non-converted gruntee 
	is then required. <br>
	<br>
	The WarGod talks to many and is often very hard to interpret. The reception 
	and interpretation of the WarGod's plans are currently left up to the Mojoka, 
	Nobs and the occasional enlightened Orc. When the WarGod needs action the 
	BloodMoons shall do it. BloodMoons following the WarGod's directions will 
	acquire objects of power and clomp the WarGod's enemies. BloodMoon orcs pride 
	themselves at being the best Lusk, Womp, and Ligz in the Clan, for which they 
	credit the WarGod's power.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a NAME="Howlurs"></a><b><i><u>Howling Skulls [Founded by JagrUk]</u></i></B></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The Howling Skull tribe is, along with the BloodMoons, one of the two oldest 
	in the Shadow Clan. Formed by JagrUk, the "Howlers" are closely aligned with 
	the wolves (or Howlers) from which they derive their name. <br>
	<br>
	Howlers are often a loud and terrifying group of orcs. In the midst of battle, 
	at the moment of victory, or for any time of celebration, it is not uncommon 
	to see a Howler raise his voice in a loud imitation of a wolf's howl. The 
	noise of their Aaaaaarrrrrrrrrooooooo!!&quot; can itself defeat many a faint-hearted 
	foe. Howlers will growl and snarl much more quickly than other orcs, not always 
	because they are genuinely angry, but just because they enjoy the effect. 
	<br>
	<br>
	In battle, the Howlers usually adopt a "Berserker attitude" whilst in combat 
	and will work themselves up into a frenzy, not halting it until either they 
	or their enemy are slain. Although they are judged to be one of the "friendlier" 
	tribes by non-orcs, they are still orcs, and very much enjoy a fight, whether 
	they win or lose (though they much prefer the latter). These orcs would never 
	surrender in combat, not that any orc does this anyway, although in the past 
	when near death one or two have been captured by enemies. Being an honorable 
	tribe, any orc (and gruntees especially) should be very wary of a Howler while 
	in combat, as they have a tendency to attack everything not "respectable" 
	in sight. <br>
	<br>
	Part of the Howler tradition is to introduce their friends, the wolves or 
	&quot;Howlerz&quot;, into their day-to-day activities. A Howler likes nothing 
	more than being accompanied by his very own "real" Howler when entering into 
	combat. They are their furry friends after all, and quite good to have as 
	extra support. The Howler orcs will very often talk to them as if they were 
	their best friends, as well as giving them food, petting them, and above all 
	else, protecting them from any dangers. If attacked by the occasional unfriendly 
	Howler (like those Dread Wolves), the Howler orc believes that it is a sign 
	that the WarGod is trying to tell him something, and is perhaps being punished 
	by the wolf spirits for some past wrong. There is an extremely tight bond 
	between the Howler orcs and the wolves of the forests, and any who oppose 
	the Howlers would do well to take this tradition into account. <br>
	<br>
	When not involved in fighting the Howlers are often thought of as lazy by 
	other orcs. Frenzied combat is tiresome on the psyche and the body, and after 
	a combat they can very well be loath to do any kind of work at all. If they 
	survive a battle and once they have dressed their wounds, the Howlers will 
	be seen just hanging around the orc fort, sitting on a chair, making snoring 
	sounds, and will appear to other orcs and non-orcs alike that they are quite 
	incapacitated. <br>
	<br>
	Oftentimes, a Howler will get a caught up in the Howler madness a bit too 
	much. If they are involved in a great deal of combat, a Howler can get stuck 
	in a frenzied berserker fit. They will be seen howling at the moon during 
	night, scratching themselves behind the ears with their feet, chasing fleas, 
	or displaying some other similar sort of temporary dementia. If this behavior 
	is observed in an orc, then it's probably a Howler in the middle of a fit. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Howler orcs often deal in a more sedate manner than the orcs from the other 
	Shadow Clan tribes. Not that they will be friendly to any non-orcs that has 
	the temerity to enter the fort without having a VERY good reason for being 
	there, but the Howlers are usually a little less inclined to "clomp" first 
	and ask questions of their ghost. Being typical greedy orcs, however, giving 
	tribute in the form of &quot;shinies&quot; or &quot;fuud&quot; can alleviate 
	much tension. <br>

  <a name="Biturs"></a><b><i><u>Head Biters [Founded by GugFruk]</u></i></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Ug! Me GugFruk, Nob of Hedbiter tribe. Hedbiters no like anybody but orcs, 
	no smellie humie, no smellie elfie, no smellie drow or pict!! Hedbiters like 
	to drink and fight, if no body to fight get drunk or fight each uder! Har...Har...Har!!! 
	Hedbiter orcs are the meanest most foul and the rudest of the orcs they like

	dat the best meal der is and save the heads in bag they smell real gud after 
	a day or two.</p>
  <p>-----------------------</p>
  <p>Though one of the original tribes, the founder, GugFruk, was an epitome of 
	what being a Hedbiter is all about, and thus, rarely awoke from his drunken 
	stupors to keep his tribe active. But then, many moons later, an upstart orc 
	by the name of Igtuk, had heard tales of the Hedbiters and longed to bring 
	them back to life. After much discussion with the Elder Nobs and the rousing 
	of GugFruk himself, Igtuk was proclaimed the second Nob of the Hedbiters and 
	they have been an active force in the Clan ever since.</p>

<p><i><b><u>Blakbluds. [Rebel Tribe, story from Kil'rogg]</u></b></i> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Zuuly's BlakBluds, referred to hereafter as the BlakBluds, were created as 
	a direct result of the Zuuly revolution, the revolution started by Gu'Clomp 
	the mojoka and named for ZugZuul (Zuuly) the HedBiter Nob. ZugZuul proclaimed 
	his disgust for the current state of the orcs, specifically their becoming 
	"civilized" and acting like "humie lovers" and stomped out of the fort to 
	wander the forests as a "true orc", a savage, bloodthirsty, hater-of-everything-not-an-orc. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Zuuly's first day in the woods was spent savagely wielding his mighty womp, 
	HumieCrusher, killing everything that crossed his path, both beast and humanoid 
	alike. Zuuly's bloodlust lasted well into the night until absolute fatigue 
	overtook him and he sunk to the ground with his back against a tree. He could 
	be heard muttering and grumbling... "crazee orks, dey forgot hoo dem is. Dey 
	forget dey fadders and dey fadders-fadders and wuts it meens ta be a ork." 
	*grumble* *mutters* Zuuly fell into an exhausted slumber. <br>
	<br>
	Zuuly dreamed, and in his dream found himself face to face with the WarGod. 
	Zuuly was still angry and disgusted from the day's events and didn't bow to 
	the WarGod. He glared at him instead. <br>
	<br>
	"Y u let orks forget past? Y u let dem go soft 'round belly and skwishy in 
	da hed? Y u turn dem into humie lubbers?" Zuuly spat at the WarGod. <br>
	<br>
	The WarGod eyes grew round with surprise. Was this orc daring to be insolent 
	to him, and in his own realm? The WarGod roared, huge neck muscles straining 
	beneath his red, leathery skin. <br>
	<br>
	"IT NUB ME! IT U AND NOBS AND ELDERS!" the WarGod bellowed shaking the glowing 
	red walls of the cavern. With a move so fast Zuuly had not the time to blink, 
	the WarGod brought his massive, two-handed, gleaming white-hot axe over his 
	head and then drove it straight down, splitting Zuuly in twain. The two sides 
	of Zuuly twitched violently, blood fountaining into the air. The WarGod thrust 
	his mighty hand into what remained of Zuuly's chest and brought out a glowing, 
	pulsing black sphere. <br>
	<br>
	Sages have argued for centuries whether the soul truly exists, and if so, 
	where it resides. What the WarGod was holding now was the true essence of 
	Zuuly, his eternal soul and very core of his being. The WarGod watched the 
	black sphere and saw streaks of blood red lightning race across it's surface. 
	An orc's sphere should be pure, jet black. These blood red streaks confused 
	the WarGod. He called to his servant, the once great Clan'Mojoka of the Shadowclan, 
	ZugRak. <br>
	<br>
	"ZUGRAK! KUM HERE NOW!" the WarGod called out, never taking his eyes off the 
	hypnotic blood red lightning. The WarGod knew that were he to crush this sphere, 
	which was in his power to do, Zuuly would cease to exist. <br>
	<br>
	ZugRak heard the call of his master and rushed to his side, immediately throwing 
	himself to the ground and bowing profusely. The WarGod looked down on ZugRak 
	and thrust his free hand into ZugRak's back, shattering his spine and crushing 
	his ribcage. ZugRak cried out in pain, for somehow he was still alive. The 
	WarGod withdrew his hand, this time holding a blood red sphere. Blood red? 
	What was this? The two spheres should be black, no other color. The ShadowClan 
	was losing it's way. This had to stop. <br>
	<br>
	He thrust the blood red sphere that was ZugRak back into ZugRak's crushed 
	body, but this time where his hand touched, rapid healing began. When he removed 
	his hand, free of the ZugRak sphere, ZugRak's body was whole again. <br>
	<br>
	The WarGod returned his attention to the ZugZuul sphere. It looked like ZugZuul 
	was fighting a war in his very soul. The taint that had corrupted ZugRak was 
	trying to take over ZugZuul. So far, ZugZuul was resisting. The WarGod smiled. 
	The WarGod spoke directly to ZugZuul's soul. <br>
	<br>
	"U MUST FIX MY ORKS. U MUST RETURN DEM TO DA OLD WAYS." And having said that, 
	he squeezed ZugZuul's soul, marking it forever so that ZugZuul would not forget. 
	<br>
	<br>
	The WarGod looked down on the shattered remains of ZugZuul's body. Looking 
	at it closely, he could see that it was the body of an archer orc. If ZugZuul 
	was to return the orcs to the old ways, he would need to wield the lusk. <br>
	<br>
	Holding his left hand palm up, he placed the sphere of ZugZuul in it and closed 
	his fingers tightly around it. With his right hand he wove circles around 
	his left hand, fingers dancing wildly. Creation mojo was at work here, and 
	when it was done, a new, more heavily muscled, meaner looking orc remained. 
	His left hand was still deep in ZugZuul's chest, and ZugZuul dangled many 
	feet from the floor. The WarGod sent energy through his left arm and down 
	into the ZugZuul sphere. ZugZuul's eyes popped open, and his mouth immediately 
	twisted into a snarl. <br>
	<br>
	"GUD. GUD." The WarGod said smiling. "NOW U NEED PARTNER." <br>
	<br>
	Zuuly growled at the WarGod. "Me nub need nub one! Me can do it by me self!" 
	<br>
	<br>
	"NUB. NUB." The WarGod corrected ZugZuul. "ORKS WORK TOGETHER. ONE ORK AGAINST 
	CLAN NUB CAN DO IT. U NEED PARTNER. WHICH ORK IS CLOSEST TO DA OLD WAYS, AN 
	ORK HOO CAN LEED DA ORKS WID U?" <br>
	<br>
	Zuuly stopped snarling and considered the WarGod's words. Who, of all the 
	orcs, was closest to the olds ways? The name came to ZugZuul immediately, 
	and he smiled an evil smile. <br>
	<br>
	"Gug'gug." Zuuly said to the WarGod. <br>
	<br>
	The WarGod snapped the fingers of his right hand and the Gug'gug sphere popped 
	into his hand. Zuuly grinned evilly. Wherever gug'gug was now, he was having 
	a soul-wrenching experience. The WarGod examined the gug'gug sphere closely. 
	It was black. ZugZuul had chosen well. There was hope yet. <br>
	<br>
	"U HAB CHOSEN WELL." the WarGod said, and released the gug'gug sphere to return 
	to gug'gug. He drew back his right arm, hand balled into a giant fist. <br>
	<br>
	"NOW NUB FORGET!" The WarGod bellowed and smashed ZugZuul straight inthe face 
	with a blow so hard that ZugZuul flew off of the WarGod's armand hit the far 
	cavern wall. ZugZuul seemed to merge with the wall andthen he was gone. <br>
	<br>
	ZugZuul woke with a start. What an incredible dream he just had. Imagine the 
	WarGod touching his soul and remaking his body. ZugZuul chuckled to himself 
	and pushed himself to his feet using his lusk for support. His lusk?!?! ZugZuul 
	looked at the weapon. It appeared quite ordinary. It was only when ZugZuul 
	spun quickly and planted the edge six inches into the tree behind and then 
	wrenched easily from it that he knew it had not been a dream. ZugZuul grinned 
	evilly. Time to go tell gug'gug.</p>

<p><a NAME="Gaashies"></a><i><b> <u>Thrak-Ghaash [Founded by Scumglug]</u></B></i></p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>One of the newer tribes in the Shadow Clan, the Thrak-Ghaash was formed from 
	some surviving orcs from the Blakblud tribe, several orcs from other tribes, 
	and a few tribeless Grunts and senior Gruntees. They established themselves 
	quickly, and even had a Warboss from their tribe within a few months of their 
	founding. This tribe believes that one of the manifestations of the Wargod 
	on the world is thru ghaash (fire). They call the Wargod Ghaashakh (the Lord 
	of Fire), and themselves the Thrak-Ghaash (literally, Bring Fire). They believe 
	that the Wargod is in the fire (or has an opening from his realm to ours through 
	the fire - as his realm is of fire). They believe that the more fire, the 
	more Wargod (or the bigger the opening, and thus the more power he can directly 
	bring through). Thus, one of their goals is to burn as much as they can, and 
	they are rarely found without at least one fire nearby. They will talk to 
	the fire. They will pray to the fire. They will cook anything they eat on 
	the fire. They will sacrifice their victims to the Wargod by putting them 
	in the fire. They will send their own dead to the Wargod on funeral pyres. 
	On trips, they will carry torches, so that the Wargod travels with them.&nbsp; 
  </p>
  <p> The Thrak-Ghaash combat style is to perform hit-and-run attacks. In fast 
	and out fast before the enemy has time to respond or get organized. If they 
	take the field, they'll spend a little extra time to light fires to burn the 
	buildings and sacrifice the victims' bodies. But they love running, and will 
	run headlong into every battle. The orcs of the this tribe revere mojokas, 
	because mojokas can actually use fire to attack! Their holy items are items 
	of Demon Breath, and for the mojokas, wands and staves of Fireballs. They 
	don't fear fire at all. They still feel pain from the fire, but revel in the 
	pain, feeling that it is the blessing of the Wargod, and brings them into 
	a state of mind where they can understand him better. Their ceremonies involve 
	bathing in fire. They proudly show their scars from the fire to one another.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Their views on the other tribes are somewhat obvious. They either regard 
	the Moonies as brothers in the Wargod, or as somewhat misguided. They see 
	the Howlers as too lazy, the Hedbiters somewhat neutrally (as the Thrak-Ghaash 
	enjoy liquor - something you can drink that will burn!), and actually like 
	the Throquats, and will gladly help in their conquests, as long as they let 
	them burn what they conquer. Their attitude towards others (like humies) using 
	fire is glee that these others are stupid enough to call forth Ghaashakh on 
	their own but without knowledge of his power, and the Thrak-Ghaash orcs have 
	even a greater respect for Ghaashakh being so clever as to fool the humies 
	into willingly bringing forth upon themselves their ultimate doom! This of 
	course is a generalization for orcs in this tribe, and not all of them will 
	follow all of these beliefs to the same extent, nor are other variations unknown. 
	This tribe can also include orcs that are basically just firebugs, or even 
	those that just love staring into the fire.</p>

<p><a NAME="Shrinku"></a><b><i><u>Srinkhu [Founded by Nub'hosh]</u></i></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Srinkhu are known as &quot;packrats&quot;. They believe that the &quot;Wargod&quot; 
	sent things to the land for orcs, and that they shouldn't be wasted.<br>
	They could be compared with a ranger. A ranger believes in not wasting the 
	lands resources, and keeping the greedy from taking more then they need. A 
	Srinkhu Orc, however, believes nearly the opposite. They believe that the 
	lands resources or other &quot;thingies&quot; shouldn't be wasted by just 
	laying on the ground, while they could be used for the greater benefit of 
	Orc Life.<br>
	<br>
	Srinkhu accomplish this goal of &quot;not wasting thingies&quot; by collecting 
	all that they can within something they call their &quot;Srinkhulag&quot;, 
	also known as a &quot;Kollekshun&quot;. This collection of objects is a way 
	they keep things from being wasted, or being harmed by Humans. Also, this 
	collection puts the items to good use because the Srinkhu shows them off with 
	pride. A Srinkhu with no Srinkhulag, is like a Hedbiter without cider. </p>
  <p>A &quot;Srinkhulag&quot; can be made up of anything... pieces of kindling...extra 
	weapons... dice..gold..jewels. As you can see, items in a Srinkhulag are not 
	particularly valuable. A Srinkhu orc would much rather have a torch, gem, 
	and dice, rather then say, a magical piece of armor.</p>
  <p>Next, through time the Srinkhu become to value one particular item for one 
	reason or another. This item, they call their &quot;Tala'rubug&quot;. These 
	special items for some reason or another, has become inseparable from the 
	orc. A Srinkhu's Tala'rubug may be a battle torn orc helm, from a great orc 
	king of the distant past, or it could be a gruntee that the Srinkhu orc has 
	especially trained and become close to.</p>
  <p>Many Srinkhu are also known for their great bargaining ability. Their is 
	basically two templates of this ability.</p>

  <p> Through the Srinkhu's history however, they have found things that are beyond

	Srinkhulag (if found on a human they are unsavable).<br>
