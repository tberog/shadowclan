  as the Shadowclan Home</font> 
<BLOCKQUOTE> 
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0"> After discounting the Cove Orc Fort as too humie-filled, 
	too large, and indefensible, the Shadowclan decided on the Yew Orc Fort as 
	their home. Another (albeit disorganized) clan of orcs was inhabiting it already, 
	but they quickly faded from view as the power of the Shadowclan grew. Life 
	for these early orc settlers was hard. They were looked upon as murderers 
	by most of the humies, visits to the Wargod were frequent, and their numbers 
	forced each of them to devote much time to non-combat skills. An activity 
	that many of them shared was the "Chaos Shrine Pilgrimage" each time they 
	visited the Wargod, sometimes several times each moon. The orcs would often 
	take a humie healer as a prisoner and force him to use his powers to benefit 
	the Wargod and his servants. The humans would try to deprive the Clan of this 
	healer, and many times the orcs had to fight to keep him alive. Typical of 
	the humies, rather than trying to rescue the healer they would kill him instead 
	whenever they could - a sure sign of the humies' truly evil nature! </p>
  <p style="margin-top: 0"> <br>
	The first Warboss Clomp was held not more than a week after the official formation 
	of the tribes. UnsGub was founder of the Bloodmoon tribe and initiated ZugRak, 
	DigDug and Azog as the first members. Digdug and Azog fought it out for who 
	would represent the Bloodmoon tribe in the Warboss clomp. A couple of days 
	after the clomp, UnsGub asked asked Azog to be the second Nob for Bloodmoon 
	and JagrUk promoted Kargrath for second Howler Nob not long afterwards. </p>
  <p>Early on in the Clan's history, several hummies would hang around the fort 
	and help fight off attackers (most notably Boz and Jobe)&nbsp; Back then, 
	the Clan was quite small, and seeing a dozen orcs awake at a time was uncommon. 
	These hummies caused all sorts of brainpain, as some orcs wanted to live or 
	die on their own, but it was hard to chase off someone who goes out of their 
	way to help. So, after much bickering and debate, it was decided that if they 
	wanted to stay, they had to sacrifice themselves to the WarGod and prove themselves 
	worthy by being re-born without visiting a healer or the Chaos Shrine (insta-res). 
	This was the early transition for hummies who wanted to become the Undead 
	and serve the WarGod, fighting alongside the Shadowclan 
  <p> In the humie month of "March" the Shadowclan gained control of the Yew Orc 
	Fort after defeating an invading army of shardies. The following description 
	was written by the departed Howler Nob, Kargrath, and is a story widely told 
	by Shadowclan orcs to this very day.<br>
	  <br>
	<b> The Shadowclan Orcs Take Control of Orc Fort</b>, as told by Kargrath<br>
	  <br>
  <blockquote> "As is probably already well known the Shadowclan Orcs moved from 
	our home on Great Lakes south of Cove to a new one in the Orc Fort south of 
	Yew on Catskills. We've resided on this shard since December. Our numbers 
	have grown along with other races appearing and springing up around us. <br>
	  <br>
	Tonight Seer Ozar visited us. At first he appeared to warn us to gather our 
	numbers and prepare to be tested. Smoke signals and bats where sent out to 
	warn the orcs that were away from the fort to return and prepare for battle. 
	Shortly after this he returned to warn us that the shardies (our word for 
	the NPC orcs, which he used as well :) ) wanted their fort back. He once again 
	promptly vanished. <br>
	  <br>
	<img src="sc_cats_hist_sa1.jpg" width="323" height="220" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">Very 
	soon after the a gruntee came running back into the fort yelling about some 
	Orc Lords chasing him. We ran to the walls only to realize that there was 
	a layer of Shardie orcs four ranks deep supported by powerful ettins on all 
	sides of the fort. We were effectively trapped. After much bloodshed the Shadowclan 
	emerged victorious.<br>
	  <br>
	Seer Ozar returned again this time to warn us not to attack every shard orc 
	we see as a emissary would be arriving. Soon after he had vanished again a 
	Shard Orc was discovered outside of the fort named King Blgrak. King Blgrak 
	of the Shard Orcs was escorted into the fort where he spoke with myself - 
	Kargrath, Howling Skulls Nob, and my adviser WaargBoom Clan Mojoka. He offered 
	a peace treaty recognizing our claim to the fort. He removed his armor and 
	surrendered. He was then escorted out of the fort. <br>
	  <br>
	Seer Ozar returned and spoke with me in the Warboss hut of the fort. He offered 
	to supply us with gruesome standards to mark our territory with, proper decorations 
	for our tents and clan hall, and signs for the front wall of the fort. He 
	also took the peace treaty and "nailed" it down to the table in the fort for 
	all to see. Gruesome Standards bearing warnings about the Shadowclan and our 
	name where placed though out the woods near our fort, and one placed along 
	the road. Our Clan tents and Hall where also properly decorated with orcish 
	banners and such."</blockquote>
