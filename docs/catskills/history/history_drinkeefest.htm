  Challenge</font> 
<P>The Drinkie Fest is the most ancient and sacred ritual of the Shadowclan. It 
  occurs in conjunction with every full moon, and is marked by a number of events, 
  the most important of which is the "Warboss Challenge". The Mak'r orcs of the 
  clan work for days non-stop to prepare the food, drink, benches, weapons, and 
  the site itself before the moon of the Drinkie Fest. In a secret mission that 
  only a handful of orcs are aware of, a different site is selected for each Fest. 
  Its true location only becomes known to the rest of the Clan on the night of 
  the fest. Many various orcs have had the lofty honor of being in charge of coordinating 
  the Drinkie Fest.</P>
<P><img src="sc_cats_hist_df1.jpg" width="325" height="244" vspace="10" hspace="10" align="left">This 
  is an event of interest to all the peoples of the lands, not just the orcs, 
  for the tribe that wins the Warboss challenge is the one that guides the Shadowclan 
  horde. Certain tribes and Warbosses are known to be more aggressive than others, 
  so the outcome of every Warboss Challenge is noted by many outside of the Clan.<BR>
  <BR>
  As it adapted over the many moons to an ever-changing Shadowclan, the Drinkie 
  Fest became much more than the Warboss Challenge and the excessive eating and 
  drinking that came before it. Some events that became associated with the Drinkie 
  fest were the Gruntee Fisty Clomp, the Blud Clomp, and occasionally there was 
  a contest for Clan Mojoka. Other events came and went over time, but the Warboss 
  Challenge was always the central one, and always the peak of the evening.<BR>
  <BR>
  Early Drinkie Fests took place at the home of the Shadowclan, in the Yew Orc 
  Fort. It soon became apparent that that arrangement would not suffice for a 
  number of reasons: human interferance and the lack of space being the most important. 
  Thus the site of each Fest became a secret and ever-changing thing.
<P>(<i>Pictured above is one of the gatherings of the Clan before travelling to 
  the secret location of the Drinkie Fest</i>)<BR>
  <BR>
  DigDug was recognized as the very first Warboss, after he defeated Kargrath 
  for the title during the early moons of the Clan (pictures of this fight are 
  known to exist, but with DigDug and Kargrath as the only orcs identified in 
  them). This early fight was a one-on-one duel, with both participants, one from 
  each tribe at that time (DigDug for the BloodMoon, Kargrath for the Howling 
  Skulls), armed with executioner's axes and standing toe-to-toe hacking each 
  other until one fell. For reasons unknown, DigDug went unchallenged during the 
  next full moon (cycle) and remained as Warboss another month.<BR>
  <BR>
  <img src="sc_cats_hist_gw1.jpg" width="353" height="348" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10">The 
  second Warboss Challenge occurred in the hummie month of "March". This time 
  a new set of rules was used that entitled each participant to choose a "battle 
  brother" from among the orcs in his tribe. DigDug (the reigning Warboss) chose 
  Orkik, and the Warboss Challenger, Glug Ughurk (see below about the "Gruntee 
  Warboss") chose GruntGlubGlub. Due to some controversy that is shrouded in the 
  depths of history, this Challenge was closely followed (possibly as early as 
  a week later) by another. Much in-fighting had occurred as a result of the change 
  in the rules, and the Elder Nobs decided that another Warboss Challenge was 
  necessary. It is not known if this event included all of the associated Drinkie 
  Fest goings-on as well. The victors of both Challenges was Glug Ughurk, who 
  would later go on to serve again as Warboss and eventually as a Nob in the Howling 
  Skulls Tribe.
<P> (<i>pictured to the right is the controversial Warboss clomp that Glug Ughurk 
  won</i>)<BR>
  <BR>
  The third Warboss Challenge, in the month of April was held at the Cove fort. 
  Grith'Nith the As-sas-un, in the disguise of a Lusk-r, became Warboss with a 
  Howling Skulls victory. That he was not truly a Lusk-r was not revealed until 
  after he lost the title at the next Drinkie Fest. <BR>
  <BR>
  A famous disruption of the Warboss Challenge occurred in the Hummie month of 
  "May" at the Cove Orc Fort. The initial events went well (despite attempts by 
  humies to disrupt them) until the arrival of an army of uninvited Shardies! 
  Angered and jealous at the Shadowclan's success, the shardies attacked in the 
  middle of the Clan's most revered ritual - the Drinkie Fest. The Warboss Candidates 
  and their battle brothers fought the battle with the weaons intended for the 
  Warboss Clomp - a first and only occurrence! At first, the Clan was driven back 
  from the wharfs, nearly to the gates of the fort itself, but as they regrouped 
  they slowly fought back the tide Shardies! The Wargod smiled upon the Shadowclan 
  Orcs that moon and denied the Shardies any further reinforcements until their 
  Tu-hed (Ettin) leader was forced to concede victory to the Clan as he dove into 
  the sea, never to be seen again. Victorous in their fight, the Clan reorganized 
  themselves, and despite the delay and some changes to the participating orcs, 
  conducted the Warboss Challenge as if the Shardie incursion had never occurred. 
  <BR>
  <BR>
  An account of this event given by the human Chronicler Ken Masters is as follows:<BR>
<blockquote>
  "As most wary adventurers know, each full moon brings about a Drinkee Fest hosted 
  by the Shadowclan Orcs. This is the one time every race of Sosaria should feel 
  safest in their presence, for they are usually too drunk from troll cider to 
  tell friend from foe! As is usually the case, the Drinkee Fest signifies the 
  time when the Shadowclan swears in a new warboss through trials of combat between 
  the strongest and most cunning orcs. As the clan has grown, new sports have 
  been added, like the Gruntee Wrestling Games and celebratory Toll Trip afterwards. 
  There is much drinking, eating, and carrying on, most of it peaceful and festive...usually."<BR>
  <BR>
  "This time, however, it wasn't the ever-present bountyhunters who showed up 
  in force, but the Shard Horde! You see, the Drinkee Fest is taken to Cove's 
  Orc Fort these days, as the number of attendees has grown incredibly, and the 
  normal fort is unable to hold enough orcs and other races. Unfortunately, the 
  Shard Horde decided to retake the Cove Fort by recruiting an ettin lord named 
  Trebrok and his minions. Wave after wave, the attackers pressed in on the Shadowclan 
  and the other attendees, sparing no one. It was not until Trebrok lost consciousness 
  that the Horde subsided. After the battle, it was agreed that next time everyone 
  should come more prepared for such an invasion. Countless orcs and non-orcs 
  were killed or knocked unconscious by the ferocious attack. Congratulations 
  go out to Bloodmoon Orc Yug for attaining the Warboss title."
</blockquote>
  <BR>
After all the blood-letting against the shardies, the Clan all went back to the 
Yew fort. There, the Elder Nob said that the Warboss Challenge must go on! With 
that, a blue mojo gate was opened, and all the remaining orcs (many were asleep 
from over-drinking and tired from all of the fighting) went back to Cove. Weapons 
were found, and even some replacement challengers for the re-start. A tough fight 
as always, in the end, the Bloodmoon tribe won, with Yug as the new Warboss. <BR>
  <BR>
  The Warboss Challenge in June was held at the Wargod's home - Hyoloth. There 
  have been many Drinkie Fests and Warboss Challenges since then, and to this 
  day they go on, carrying on the traditions of the Shadowclan Orcs.<BR>
<P><BR>
  Despite the well-regulated nature of the Fest, there were many times when outside 
  interference halted the entire proceeding or transferred the Warboss Challenge 
  into a storm of controversy. The sources of these disturbances have been many, 
  and every time caused bitter fighting either inside the Clan or with outside 
  forces.<BR>
  <BR>
  Nearly from the beginning, the Warboss Challenge has often been disrupted by 
  outside events. One of the more controversial, as mentioned above, was the second 
  one. After a participant (some say it was Glug Ughurk) left the ring to attack 
  an unnamed archer who had fired at him for unknown reasons. It is also not known 
  who attacked first, Glug or the archer (who may have been a Moonie, or may have 
  been Undead). The resulting free-for-all resulted in Glug being named as Warboss, 
  about which the entire Bloodmoon tribe was extremely upset. At the refight of 
  that match a number of moons later, Glug won again, the Moonies were angry still, 
  and DigDug was so distraught that he left the fort not to return for many moons.<BR>
  <BR>
  In subsequent Warboss Challenges other types of controversies occurred. In one, 
  there was interference from the Dark Dwarves, supposedly because they were in 
  the employ of one of the Shadowclan tribes, the Howling Skulls. A Womp-r orc 
  (actually the Blud'Womp-r at the time!) Zoot was charged with disrupting the 
  sacred ritual and was sent to see the Wargod permenantly.<BR>
  <BR>
  On another occasion, the weapon of one of the contestants was found to be poisoned 
  after the match, but no responsibility was ever claimed or discovered for that 
  misdeed.<BR>
  <BR>
  It has been said that a Warboss Challenge without controversy isn't really a 
  good one, and there is nothing orcs like to do better than complain about how 
  they were cheated out of their chance for victory.<BR>
  <BR>
  The early methods of determining the Warboss are little known, though it can 
  be fairly safely assumed that they began as struggles for supremacy of the Clan. 
  Very simply, if an orc thought he was the strongest, he told the other orcs 
  what to do. If another orc thought he was stronger, he fought the other orc 
  for the right to be the leader. Eventually, this process became so bloody and 
  destablizing, that Challenges were limited to one per cycle (month). After tribes 
  developed, each tribe would send a representative orc who would fight in the 
  name of his tribe. In later times, a second orc "battle brother" was allowed 
  to participate. This second orc could not become Warboss, but would act as the 
  Warboss's Bodyguard if he were to win. Still later, a second Battle Brother 
  was added, so that each tribe was permitted to enter one Warboss Candidate and 
  two other orcs in the competition. On occasion, a tribe does not have enough 
  orcs to fill the slots in the challenge and they try to win with fewer.<BR>
  <BR>
  One famous story of an early Warboss is that of the "Gruntee Warboss". Only 
  a Gruntee when the moon set that morning, Glug Ughurk, was blooded a Grunt in 
  the Howling Skulls Tribe on the same day as the Drinkie Fest. Other Howlers 
  bluded that moon included KarGrula, Na Zul, and Urgrubuk. Suprisingly, Glug 
  was made their Warboss Candidate! Whether this was from a lack of Lusk-rs and 
  Womp-rs (the K'igg-r bloodline was very new at that time) is not known. Though 
  little chance was given for him to win, win he did, and Glug Ughurk became known 
  as the "Gruntee Warboss".<BR>
