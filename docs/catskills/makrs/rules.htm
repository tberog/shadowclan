<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">Rules: 
    Respect and Teamwork</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Combat</font></b><br>
    Mak'rs are allowed to walk around armed using the weapons of the appropriate 
    Mak'r Path, but you are not allowed to play your Mak'r as a &quot;warrior&quot; 
    character. Use your Grunt for such role play.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You are not allowed to 
    start a combat fight with a Grunt or higher (exceptions are Mog'ob'goth, Sharkuu 
    and Big Mak'r). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Mak'rs are not highlighted 
    to any guilds. This is to ensure that Mak'rs can safely visit towns to gather 
    BODs and receive healing aid from orcs on the Shadowclan Orcs Gakh guildstone. 
    Do not use your non-highlighted status to get away with taunting any guilds 
    Shadowclan Orcs are warred with.<br>
    <br>
    You are allowed to go on trips with the exception of if it is a trip to kill 
    highlighted guilds. <br>
    <br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><b>Ranks</b></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
    </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Respect chain of 
    command. At no time are you allowed to refuse a Nob or Blood Leader the use 
    of your services or refuse to obey their direct order.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">You will obey and respect 
    those Mak'rs higher ranked than you.<br>
    <br>
    Do not deny any orc your services over Tribal differences.<br>
    <br>
    </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Resources, 
    BODs, and Vendors</font></b><br>
    Mak'rs are encouraged to collect BODs and store them at the Mak'r Hut. All 
    BOD rewards go to benefit Shadowclan Orcs and trusted Mak'rs will be given 
    the rewards (powerscrolls, runic sewing kits, runic hammers) to use in appropriate 
    ways. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Replenish 
    resources that you borrow, or inform the Big Mak'r of resources you have taken 
    which you cannot replenish (ex. if you cannot mine Valorite but use some to 
    make an orc an item). Public resources will be kept in the Mak'r hut beside 
    the fort. Backstock will be kept in Leadership access.<br>
    <br>
    Orcs at Buorca rank may place a vendor in a house near the fort and should 
    be themed (ex. Prel runs a Bang'r snagga, Kragnagh runs a Stich'r snagga). 
    All gold earnings must be reported monthly to the Big Mak'r and vendors must 
    be emptied out of gold at the first of every month, then passed on in check 
    or pile form to the Big Mak'r. Gold will go to supplies for Mak'rs and Shadowclan.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Skills 
    and Powerscrolls</font></b> <br>
    Powergaming is not allowed. Create role playable situations to make items 
    (ex. making forts out of benches and crates). </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Unattended macroing, 
    which is a bannable offense to OSI, will result in the removal of your Mak'r 
    and all Grunt characters from Shadowclan. </font></p>
  <p> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Powerscrolls at the 
    appropriate rank may be taken as long as the Big Mak'r is aware. If you wish 
    to have a skills above your designated rank, you may seek promotion as a method 
    to allow higher skill.<br>
    Tala: +5 powerscrolls <br>
    Buorca: +10 powerscrolls <br>
    Durub: +15 powerscrolls<br>
    Mog'Ob'Goth/Big Mak'r: +20 powerscrolls<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Other</b></font></font><br>
    All Mak'rs are allowed to have beetles. It is recommended that you have a 
    beetle rather than a pack animal to avoid the threat of shardies. However, 
    do not ride the beetle unless given permission by a Leader or in a situation 
    where no orcs are present and you must save the beetle from monster attacks.</p>
