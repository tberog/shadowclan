  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">Urucku: 
    Dedication and Purpose</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
    Buorca, which stands for Selfless Teamwork, represents the attitude of the 
    Mak'r Bloodline. In order to be a Mak'r, one must be willing to dedicate endless 
    time to hard work. However, one may expect help and teamwork from the entire 
    Bloodline. Each Mak'r should support one another, and indeed the rest of Shadowclan 
    participates in the teamwork as well. The entire Clan gathers resources as 
    Mak'rs work to provide what Shadowclan needs. As Orcs are not allowed to use 
    items made by non-orc hands, Mak'rs are kept busy on a daily basis. It is 
    tough work, but rewarding, for orcs will always remember a good weapon that 
    led to a victory in battle.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The Buorca Shrine is 
    located in the center of the Orc Mining Caves in Yew. It is a short run along 
    the mountains northeast of the Yew Orc Fort. All Mak'rs must be familiar with 
    this place. It is where offerings are given to Wargod in selfless sacrifice. 
    It is the place where Buorca is taught.<br>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">Ranks: 
    Overviews, Rules, Equipment</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><br>
    All Mak'rs wear the brown half apron regardless of rank. All Mak'rs may choose 
    to wear a regular orc helmet. All Mak'rs, excluding Nubkuu, may wear an evil 
    orc helmet. No Mak'r, with the exception of Big Mak'r, is allowed at any time 
    any type of human attire, which includes kilts, pants, and shirts. </font></p>
