<br><font color="#FFFF99">A gruntee should not talk to humies if a higher

<p style="margin-top: 0"><font color="#FFFF99">All grunts are allowed to ressurect using bandages.&nbsp;</font>

<p style="margin-top: 0"><a NAME="guildwar"></a><b>Guildwar Rules</b>
<p>Stay in character.
<br><font color="#FFFF99">Show respect for your enemies, do not try to
ruin their fun.</font>
<br>Try to avoid becoming criminals or murderers
around the clan fort.
<br><font color="#FFFF99">Will follow the simplified rules of engagement (SRoE)</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>The simple rules of engagement (SRoE) are:
<br>&nbsp;<font color="#FFFF99">(1) do not attack players that obviously
have lost connection,</font>
<br>&nbsp;(2) after resurrecting, a player remains in death robes, and
doesn't talk, and doesn't participate further in
<br>that battle (or for 30 minutes, whichever is shorter). Death robed
players that follow this rule are not to be
<br>attacked. Death&nbsp; robed players may loot their own corpses.
<p>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="looting"></a><b>Looting Rules</b>
<p><font color="#FFFF99">(1) Gruntees do not touch highlighted bodies.</font><br>
(2) No orcs loot highlighted bodies unless some compelling roleplayed reason
exists to do so, or if the situation warrants pre-emptive looting in order to
protect a person’s items from 3rd party looters or decay.<br>
<font color="#FFFF99">(3) In the case of NPC or non-highlighted kills, the
highest ranked orc present is in charge of looting. No other orc touches the
body unless directed to do so by that ranking orc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0">(4) Loot only things YOUR OWN orc can use (food, drinks including potions,
gold, potions, arrows if ligzr, reagents if Mojoka, anything taken from the orc,
weapon if it is allowed
by your bludline, nobs can loot anything any orc uses).&nbsp; In some
circumstances you should also take away the victim's fighting capability
(weapons, arrows, reagents) if they are a threat to continue the fight.
<p>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="punishment"></a><b>Punishment</b><b></b>
<p>Depending on the rule violated, punishment may involve having certain
items confiscated, having a bad report sent to the bludline leader, being
clomped, being demoted, inventive punishments, and/or
in very very severe cases being clomped to death by a bloodline leader
or nob.&nbsp; Having bad reports sent to your bloodline leader can delay
your promotion to grunt.
