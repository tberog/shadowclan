<blockquote>
<p>The Bahmi are the curious and reclusive denizens of the Rhaza'de Canyons. Their elemental ancestors, the Shalastiri, arrived on Telara through a rift from the Plane of Air at the time of the first Blood Storm Wars. Led by their prince, Bahmi, they proved invaluable warriors in the fight against the dragon gods.</p>

<p>But Bahmi's decision to aid Telara was also marked with tragedy. The placement of the Ward meant he and his companions would never be able to return to their homeland; despite this they stayed, and fought valiantly. With the Ward in place, and peace returned to Telara, Bahmi's people settled in the canyons, breeding with humans and forming a new race.</p>

<p>Despite a brutish reputation, Bahmi idealize hospitality, the pursuit of excellence, and community above all else. In strength of arms, the Bahmi are beyond measure, and their craftsmanship is superior. When the Eth Empire fell, many of the refugees found haven in the Bahmi lands, creating a deep bond between the two peoples.</p>

<p>The Bahmi cover themselves in very intricate and magical tattoos called "sefir". The application of sefir is all that remains of the Bahmi's elemental heritage, and they recognize great accomplishments in a Bahmi's life. The tattoos recount the personal histories of each Bahmi, while also providing a sizable source of imbued elemental power.</p>

<h2>Want to make an alternate character?</h2>

<p>Shadowclan was originally created as a guild for alternate characters (Ultima Online 1997 "Lets all make orc characters"). That tradition is carried over into Warhammer Online by allowing anyone to join without any special out of game applications or references. But Shadowclan has also grown to become a home for many players who play Shadowclan characters exclusively. We try and provide a fun and entertaining stop for players of all kinds, offering an alternative style of playing the game that you rarely find in other guilds.</p>




<h2>Joining the Clan</h2>

<p>Ready to try? Read our page about <a href="join.htm">creating a Shadowclan Bahmi</a>.</p>

<p>Once your character has been created, you should try and meet up with a clan member to make sure your character meets the standards. The Shadowclan Bahmi can be found on the Sunrest server in Warhammer Online. Once you login with your Bahmi character, type in a <i>/who Shadowclan</i> command and send tells to any Shadowclan player you see online for an invite into the guild. It is recommnded that you look over the <a href="rules.htm">rules</a> and the <a href="language.htm">language</a> pages before asking for a guild invitation.</p>
