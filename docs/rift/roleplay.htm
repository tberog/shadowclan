<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<p>You are encouraged to use /say as much as possible rather than restricting speech to private chat channels. Part of Shadowclan philosophy is to make the game fun for others, and letting other players nearby listen to our in-character speech is a large part of that.</p>

<p>It is not required that you develop an extended background with specific quirks in order to roleplay, but many people find it makes their gaming experience more interesting and fun and also helps guide them in becoming their character. The most important part of roleplaying is staying in character. Try to respond and act as you imagine your character would when confronted with situations in-game, even if the other player is behaving in a way that is inconsistent with your character's perspective.</p>



<h2>Shadowclan Specific Roleplay</h2>

<p>Shadowclan represents a faction of the Bahmi race that longs for a return to their elemental origins and
one day, to their ancestral Shalastiri homeland. They do not breed further with the race of Man, and are
selective in picking mates with the strongest characteristics of the Shalastiri.</p>

<p>For this reason, the Shadowclan physically does not display the lighter pink skins of further intermingling
of human bloodlines, but rather as a whole, they are a bit bigger, and a deep rich purple in skin tone.
Indeed, it is a deadly insult among the Shadowclan to refer to one as “Pinky” and is guaranteed to lead to
the spilling of blood.</p>

<div id="sidebarLeft"><h6>GAME HINT</h6>Check out our History and Lore section. It not only has info about Bahmi in general, but it also contains the background for Shadowclan in Rift. This is a good place to start when thinking about how to roleplay a Bahmi.</div>

<p>As to their agenda, they seek to find a way to bypass the wards that prevent their entry back through the
Rift to the Plane of Air, for only then can they hope to return to their full power and glory. A second
goal, no less important, they must find a way to the icy halls of the Storm Queen’s prison, and destroy
Crucia, known to us as Agarluu in our native tongue, once and for all.</p>

<p>For all know that if Crucia the Betrayer, Dragon of the Plane of Air, ever freed herself from her prison,
would not only regain her full power within the Plane of Air, but would also take cruel pleasure in the
destruction her own betrayers, those who took on the name Bahmi.</p>

<p>Obviously, after the Defiant failure with Regulos, if the the rest of the Defiant faction knew
Shadowclans’s true goals, they would be hunted down as surely as if they had openly proclaimed loyalty
to the Gods of the Guardians. Even others of the Bahmi race would find their actions damning and react
with violence towards their brethren.</p>

<p>Thus Shadowclan must keep their true goals close to their hearts, and tend to keep to themselves when at
all possible. Outsiders must not be trusted, not even others of the Bahmi. One day, homecoming.</p>


<h2>Tribute, Territorym and Yabanci Relations</h2>

<p>The paramount rule is not to ruin the fun of others while staying in character. This means not pushing the
Bahmi bit so far that other players are insulted or offended. Try to role-play with them if you wish, but
leave them alone if they're not getting it or not enjoying it. Don't forget that every single player in this
game is a potential recruit for the Dragon's demise. Also, all rules governing player conduct in the TOS
are expected to be adhered to, no exceptions.</p>

<p>Silverwood is the starting land for Guardians. Most players here are quite new and not flagged for PvP.
While it’s fun to interact with the enemy, and klomp the occasional player that gets the nerve to shoot
you, in general unless there is a planned event, members should avoid this area. All other areas are fair
game.</p>

<p><b>Random Guardian interaction</b> – PvP is the rule. Interact in character, possibly try some creative tribute
demands (cash isn’t an option unless you klomp them, sadly.) Invite the guardian player to role-play with
you. At worse, someone dies anyways, at best you may have a nice RP story to tell.</p>

<p><b>Organized Raids upon Guardians</b> – They know why you’re there, we know why we’re there. Keep all
shouts and says in character, but klomp on sight. Then cap the ward stone.</p>

<p><b>Defense of Defiant Territory</b> – same as above.</p>


<h2>Dueling</h2>

<p>Typically, don’t. There may arise occasions when ritual or honor demand it, these events then should be
role played with some formality. If you simply want to fight, get in line for the War Front, the Shatru will
be happy to accommodate you.</p>
