<a name="Chain of Comman"><h2>Chain of Command</h2></a>

Shadowclan has strict and absolute policies regarding chain of command. Lower-rank characters are
expected to obey all orders from any higher-rank characters, at all times without question. If you believe
an order is incorrect do it anyway.

If you believe an order violates Shadowclan policy, see above and also contact a guild officer to report the
issue; take screenshots or a recording if possible. A senior member issuing orders to players in a different
group should issue his orders to or through the group leader only. A group leader is considered to outrank
anyone else in his group of the same rank.

In the event of conflicting orders, obey the higher ranking member; in the event of conflicting orders from
two members of equal ranks, obey an individual in your group before one who is not.

The rank structure in the Shadowclan branch is as follows:

<ul>
	<li><b>Khan</b> - Clan leader</li>
	<li><b>Tumen</b> - War Boss. Responsible for all things warlike.</li>
	<li><b>Tajin</b> - Craft Boss. Responsible for organizing crafters and seeing that materials are gathered and
dispensed properly.</li>
	<li><b>Noyan</b> - Senio Officer</li>
	<li><b>Darga</b> - Junior Officer</li>
	<li><b>Sain</b> - These are Full Clan members who have sworn their oath to Shadowclan. As the main force of any Shadowclan branch, they set good examples by following the rules and helping guide clan members who are still learning our ways.</li>
	<li><b>Hamji</b> - Initiate member to Shadowclan, they have proven they understand the basic rules and can follow orders, which is the bare minimum expected of a Shadowclan Bahmi.</li>
	<li><b>Magu</b> - Disciplinary rank. Not normally used.</li>
</ul>




<a name="promotions"><h2>Promotions</h2></a>

<p>Promotions will be based upon merit. Promotion from recruit to full member will be a simple test of
knowledge covering Shadowclan procedures and rules and a demonstrated ability to use and understand
the basic words of the language structure.</p>

<p>Promotions to the General Officer Rank requires a more in depth understanding of Shadowclan structure
as well as a demonstrated ability towards leading and organizing activities among fellow clan members.
Testing still to be devised, will be administered by the Senior Officer rank, and if passed, presented to
Leadership for final approval.</p>

<p>Leadership Promotions are subject to approval of the Clan Helm.</p>
