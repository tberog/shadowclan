<h2>General</h2>


<p>All Shadowclan players are expected to obey the chain of command.</p>

<p>All Shadowclan players are expected to behave in an appropriate manner both in-game and on the game forums.</p>


<h2>Equipment And Economy</h2>

<p>Shadowclan historically operates with a communal economy. There is no private ownership of items or
coin. All property held by any Shadowclan character is considered to be owned by the guild.</p>

<p>All members are asked to hold on to any looted gear items that could be used by fellow members, if no
takers are found for the gear items, they may dispose of it as they see fit. All raw materials and cash are
still considered Clan property, under no circumstances is it allowed to transfer these resources to
characters outside of the guild, personal or otherwise.</p>

<p>All members of Shadowclan are expected to take one gathering skill. The choices are Butcher, Miner, or
Forager. All members, with the exception of Hamji, may take additional crafting skills so long as they
register their intent with the Tajin. Hamji are expected to provide all gathered materials to the Tajin for
distribution to regular crafters. Surplus materials will be sold on the auction house and the proceeds
transferred to the Clan treasury. Those crafters recognized as regular suppliers may ask for assistance in
expanding vault storage.</p>

<p>Each member may manage their expenses out of their loot and reward income for a Shadowclan
character, as they see fit so long as it doesn’t violate the above stated rules. Surplus funds beyond their
needs would be welcomed by the Clan Treasury, but is not required.</p>
	
<h2>Uniforms</h2>

<p>No current restrictions, other than headgear at this time - Rift allows a wide variety of dyes to be applied
to clothing and armor. It is quite possible to choose uniform color combinations in the near future to
distinguish between rank, officer and leader.</p>

<p>Hamji are forbidden to display head gear, and must turn headgear off under <i>Options</i></p>


<h2>Grouping</h2>

<p>When grouping, you are expected to group with Shadowclan members where possible. When in a
Shadowclan group, listen and obey the Bahmi in charge of the group.</p>

<p>If you are in-game at the time of a scheduled clan-wide event, you must try to attend the event. Not only
are they fun, but they are a good way to see what Shadowclan is really all about.</p>

<p>Each group will have a defined leader. The leader is the senior ranking member of the group. In the
event that all things are equal regarding seniority, the group will settle upon the leader before continuing.
General looting will operate upon the Need / Greed system.</p>

<p>This person will collect any special (rare (blue) and above) items not immediately usable by any group
member and not bind on pickup and deliver them to the Tijan for distribution at the first reasonable
opportunity. Anything that is defined as soul bind on pickup, and is not immediately usable by a group
may be rolled upon using Need / Greed.</p>


<h2>In-game Speech</h2>

<p>One of our most important rules is that all Shadowclan characters speak in Bahmi on ALL chat channels, including say, shout, party, warband, regional, etc. Do not use parentheses or other markings to indicate that you're speaking out of character. Just dont speak out of character at all. Tells to other Shadowclan may be out of character if necessary. All in-game communication with non-Shadowclan players must be in-character regardless of mode. This is an important part of the Shadowclan identity and roleplay.</p>
