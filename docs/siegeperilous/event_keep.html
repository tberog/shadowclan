<h2>
A Stronghold Built on Fields of Blood</h2></center>
The Shadowclan Orcs had wandered curiously around the stone walls for several
days. The new keep that had mysteriously appeared with the waving arms
and incantations of the Mog'Goth, upon inspection revealed itself to be
a durable fortification, perhaps even stronger than the orc fort itself.
The mojoka were quick to set up their extensive rune library, and some
grunts enslaved a human to work a cider tavern on the second floor. All
was well, or so an orc would think.
<p>What no orc could possibly fathom at the time was that the Stronghold
was forever cursed, with a curse more powerful than any house sign or deed
to a house. The Keep had been built upon the rotting corpses and graves
of countless humans and orcs. As warriors of all races had fought and struggled
for superiority on the blood-stained meadow, so too would the Stronghold
struggle for a true owner. For once every month, the true owners of the
Stronghold would be those who could take it and hold it.
<p>Who would gain the right to live in the stronghold and the powers that
came with it? Would the Shadowclan Orcs be able to maintain control? Or
would humans gain a key foothold in orc territory, and if so, which humans?

<h2>
Playing for Keeps</h2></center>
We will GIVE OUR KEEP (for a week) to whoever has managed to kick us out
and keep us out of our keep.  When the doors are locked at the end of the hour the event is OVER, and whoever controls
the KEEP gets friended to it, and gets newly changed keys.
<p>For one week you can use the KEEP for whatever you want with only a
couple minor restrictions (covered later).
<center>
<h3>
Rules and Regulations (as few as possible)</h3></center>
Whoever has the most alive members in uniform and inside the keep at 9pm
wins.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only members of Shadowclan count as members of the Shadowclan
group.
<p>During the battle, dragons, deamons, and other pets may be banned from
the keep. You are free to use them outside all you want. (We will not ban
horses, but we will ban nightmares and hero steeds).
<p>You might be friended to the keep during the event if you are successful
in entering it.&nbsp; This is so you won't be booted out of the keep if
you lose connection.&nbsp; <b><font color="#FFFFCC">Do not abuse being
friended</font></b> by ejecting players or other advantages friends have.&nbsp;
Doing so may result in your being banned from the keep and future events
there.
<p>All that matters is who has the most number of alive members properly
identified inside the keep at the end of the event. How you got that control doesn't matter.
<p>Guilds are encouraged to team up and dress in a unique color so that
declaring a winner at the end of the evening is easier. The team with the
most living/uniformed players inside the KEEP at the end will be the winners.
(Deathrobe gray is not a uniform). Orcs and claim the right of no uniform.&nbsp;
2 teams with similar color uniforms is not the Orc's problem.
<p>Please refrain from killing the keep co-owners that are doing the friending
and making sure the event goes smoothly.&nbsp; (Gorgdaguud)

<h3>
What the winners get</h3></center>
Once the winning team is declared, the doors to the keep will be locked.
Anyone left in the keep that is not on the winning team will be revealed
and ejected. All members of the winning team will be ressurected. All members
of the winning team (up to 48 members) will be friended to the keep. The
orcs will then leave.
<p>Only those attending the battle will be friended. No one will be added
later on.
<p>The keys to the KEEP will be left in secure chests. The orcs guarantee
that the only key kept by the orcs will be in the bank box of the KEEP's
owner and won't be used by the orcs. Orcs will NOT keep any other keys.
However orcs are free to kill you later and loot a key.
<p>All human weapons and armor collected by the orcs prior to and during
the battle will be left in the secure chests.&nbsp; Orc co-owners pledge
not to use the secure chests during the week.
<p>For one week, the winners will remain friended to the keep. They may
use the keep in whatever way they wish, including parties (orcs love parties),
battles (same), traing sessions (gah), staging wars against the orcs (grin),
or any other use.
<p>The only restriction is that the winners cannot ban other players from
the keep. Orcs will clear the ban list often, and anyone caught specifically
banning people will be removed from the friend's list. Banning pets is
OK.
<p>After one week the friend's list will be cleared, the keep made public,
and an orc bar will be opened on the 2nd level.
<p>If all goes well, another battle with the same conditions will be held
on the first sunday of each month.
