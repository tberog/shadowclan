<strong>Looting :</strong> Take what you can immediately use. Orcish weapons and armor, gold, etc. Should also take away victim's fighting capability (weapons, arrows, reagents) if they are a threat to continue the fight. If on toll trip, just take toll. If player was verbally abusive, take a bit more. Use good judgement. Don't ruin the fun of others. Never trash another player's equipment. Keep in mind this is a PvP shard designed to be harsh. Higher ranked orcs have priority on looting. Only Shadowclan orcs can loot on Shadowclan territory and orc lead trips. As for looting other Shadowclan orcs - use your head and be aware of the potential consequences. If (and only if) you are a higher rank - take what you need or want. Everyone of every rank should pick up and hold things for your fellow orcs if you can. Remember we are a community and can't function if we cripple our own members.
<br><br>
<strong>Murder count :</strong> Orcs are required to be "red murderer" at all times. (Rare exceptions granted only by specific approval of clan leadership). This means you must have at least 5 murder counts at all times (you can easily get these by killing other new orcs at the fort, or helping to kill attacking humies.)</div>
<br>
	<div class="TextT1Md">
<strong>Thingies :</strong> All items of any kind in an orc's possession technically belong to the Shadowclan community. Orcs are NOT allowed to use banks. Orcs are NOT allowed to be friended or co-ownered to any building. Only exception to the house rule are buildings maintained by Shadowclan. All grunts will have access to one building for shared storage purposes. Orcs are NOT allowed to have boats unless they have permission. 
<br><br>
<strong>Other :</strong> Stay In Character at all times while in-game. Follow the equipment guidelines and the chain of command. Do not call anyone Dewds or Pks. They are all "pushdug humies" (stinky humans). Do not be judgemental regarding the playstyle of other players. Do not whine about how other players play the game (in-game or out of game). We chose to come here and deal with the challenges of this unique shard. If a problem can't be handled in-character, handle it out of game. Show respect for each other, and other players not in Shadowclan.
