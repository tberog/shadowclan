Shadowclan began on Siege Perilous as a chaotic band of gruntees. Over time, more and more orcs advanced to the rank of grunt, bringing some stability and order to the clan. Eventually twenty five grunts from three different tribes (the skull krackers, battle surgins, and blakfists) came together and formed the Hukor Rukh, an army deticated to the legendary warrior orc Hukor. The first warboss of this Rukh was the Blakfist Parfug, and he led the clan to many a great victory over the humans. 
<br /><br />
As the clan grew in size, the Krath'Kuul Rukh emerged. Founded by the aged mojoka K'Dahbruh, the Krath'Kuul Rukh literally means "Army of Servants to the Gods." Two tribes initially populated the Krath'Kuuls, the Followers of the Buurz'Ash and the Kyn'Tahj Tribe. 
<br /><br />
The two Rukhs united first under the Warlord Parfug. 
<br /><br />
Over the years, many Warlords, tribes and even Rukhs have come and gone. What happens in the future is in the hand of the orcs themselves.</div>
