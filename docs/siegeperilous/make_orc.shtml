Remember, only one character is allowed per account on Siege Perilous. So do it right the first time. 
<br><br>
Select "Advanced" character creation. Select 40 Strength, 30 Dexterity, and 10 Intelligence. Pick 50 hiding (must be able to hide to join). As an orc, you can use any skill EXCEPT magery, Chilvary, and Necromancy. Only Mojokas and Magruka can use magery or necromancy. You must first be a grunt to be eligible to apply to be a Mojoka or Magruka. 
<br><br>
Choose an Orcish Name. Click <a class="textLink" href="names.shtml">here</a> for some example names. Note that your name must not be based on humie words, it must have proper capitalization, and must not be in use by another member. Add apostrophes to help make your name unique and do a name search <a class="textLink" href="http://my.uo.com/cgi-bin/guilds.pl?g=ef2308970b768100:13">here</a> or <a class="textLink" href="http://my.uo.com/cgi-bin/guilds.pl?g=17ed869940d9fd62:13">here</a> to make sure you aren't using someone else's name. Then you may want to click on "Get Help" to verify that your name is acceptable.
<br><br>
Select NO hair, and NO facial hair. Orcish light green skin is strongly preferred (2 from the right, 3 from the top is a pretty good color). You can be a male or a female orc. 
<br><br>
Start in Yew, and go straight to the orc fort. Click on "Orc Territory" for directions. It is useful to know some orcish words starting out, click "Orc Language"
