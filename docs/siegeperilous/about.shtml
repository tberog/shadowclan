Shadowclan is about roleplaying orcs and having fun while not ruining the fun of others. We roleplay orcs that are often hostile to anyone invading our lands. If you are looking for a fun community oriented guild with emphasis on roleplay and group cooperative PvP, then look no further. If you are a humie, looking to interact with us, expect to battle with us unless you manage to offer cider and food to distract us long enough to get away. Any human in the orc fort will be attacked. 
For those familiar with Shadowclan on Catskills, please note that Shadowclan Siege Perilous has different rules and structure. Read up on the Shadowclan rules and note that we are much more aggressive on this shard. If you encounter problems with members of Shadowclan on Siege Perilous, click on Problems to the left.
