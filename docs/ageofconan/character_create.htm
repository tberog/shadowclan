<p>At launch there are three nationalities in Age of Conan. Aquilonian, Cimmerian, Stygian. All three are allowed for a Shadowclan Pict. If more nationalities are added at a later time they will be addressed at that time. Do not expect Shadowclan to move quickly to embrace changes.</p>

<p>At launch there are twelve classes in Age of Conan. Guardian, Dark Templar, Conqueror, Priest of Mitra, Tempest of Set, Bear Shaman, Barbarian, Assassin, Ranger, Demonologist, Herald of Xocil, Necromancer. All twelve are allowed. Similar caveats about future expansions apply to classes just as nationalities.</p>

<p>There is no limit as to what class your pict can be. Some classes are obviously more suited to combat in less protective armor, but the choice is up to you. Guardians, Conquerors and Dark Templars all have unique abilities and it is up to you to decide if you can have fun playing one of these classes without a full array of excellent armor. Obviously some classes will need to have some specific lore developed to explain their powers, but class names are only words and so are spells. Pict shamans are wielders of bizarre spells and strange ritual magic that is unknown to most of the civilized races.</p>

<h2>Appearance and Character Creation Choices</h2>

<p>First off I will give some information gleaned from various websites on the Pict, their role in the Hyborian world and Pictish culture in general.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Pict are short, very dark, with black eyes and hair. They are broad-shouldered, deep-chested, lean-hipped, thickly-muscled, naked except for scanty doe-skin loin-clouts.</p>

<p>Their faces are immobile, but their narrow eyes glitter with the fire that burns in the eyes of a stalking tiger. When a Pict stands motionless, the very beasts pass without noticing.</p>

<p>There is a difference by clan in the barbaric tribal designs painted on their faces and breasts. There is also difference between warrior's and hunter's marks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that in mind what follows is our effort to recreate Pict as best we can with the tools given. The following is a list of all options you are presented with at character creation with comments on their acceptability. A Shadowclan Pict must follow all guidelines.</p>
