<blockquote>
<p>They live in tents of hides and brush-thatched huts of mud and wattle where hang the grinning skulls of men. In mud-walled enclosures fires flicker and drums rumble, and spears are whetted in the hands of silent men in moccasins. Villages are surrounded by a stockade with a broad gate. A low, hideous pyramid of gory human heads can be seen in the middle.</p>


<p>They raid into the mountains of Zingara for tin. Ships from Zingara occasionally come and trade weapons and ornaments and wine to the coastal tribes for hides, whale teeth, walrus tusks, copper ore and gold dust. Sometimes they trade ostrich plumes from Kush. The Pictish shamans place great store by them. They know how to plant grain and do it sketchily, but prefer to steal it from their neighbors the Bossonians and Zingarans. The clans are generally at feud with each other, and their simple customs are blood-thirsty.</p>

<h2>What Shadowclan Picts are About</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Roleplay - Shadowclan Picts are always in character.</li>
	<li>Open Membership - Anyone can create a Pict following character creation guidlines and join.</li>
	<li>Community - Picts fight together, live together and die together. Everything belongs to the Clan, everyone shares supplies freely amongst themselves.</li>
	<li>Game Friendly - Our storyline and background blend in with the game's storyline and background to the highest degree possible. We won't force other players to break character in order to match our own role play style. We follow the rules of the game. No Cheating, bug exploitation, illegal 3rd party programs, or other violations of the Terms of Service are ever allowed.</li>
	<li>Commitment - In order to remain part of Shadowclan after an initial trial period, a Pict must permanently commit their characters to Shadowclan.</li>
	<li>Respect - We respect other players as fellow players.</li>
	<li>Making the game more fun - We have fun and try to increase the fun for others by providing an intelligent enemy as an alternative to NPC's</li>
	<li>Quality - We train our new members in the Shadowclan ways and our expectaions are enforced.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Want to make an alternate character?</h2>

<p>Shadowclan is originally a guild for alternate characters (Ultima Online 1997 "Lets all make orc characters") and here in Age of Conan, Cimmeria Server, the branch is designed to be a great guild for alternate characters ("Lets all make Pict characters"), offering an alternative style of playing the game that you rarely find in other guilds.</p>




<h2>Joining the Clan</h2>

<p>Ready to try? Read our page about <a href="character_create.htm">creating a Shadowclan Pict</a>.</p>

<p>Once your character has been created, you should try and meet up with a clan member to make sure your Pict meets the standards. The Shadowclan Picts can be found on the Cimmeria server in Age of Conan. (NEED DETAILS ABOUT HOW TO MEET UP/JOIN INGAME)</p>
