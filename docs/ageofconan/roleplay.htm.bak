<blockquote>
<p>They may use their teeth in fight. They slash throats from ear to ear. They are known to scalp enemies.</p>

<p>The worst insult you can give a Pict is to throw him into a cell.</p>

<p>There are huge serpents in that forest which sometimes hang by their tails from branches high above and so snare their prey. They are the only things a Pict fears.</p>

<p>Their shamans can transfer the soul of a captured enemy into a serpent. Then both are beheaded. And his foe should dwell in the body of a serpent throughout his next reincarnation.</p>

<p>The Picts are a ruder, more practical, more prolific race. They left no pictures painted or carved on ivory, as did their enemies, but they left remarkably efficient flint weapons in plenty.
The lands of the Picts are rife with game and fish. Having no need of animal husbandry or agriculture, the Picts have never developed the kind of structured society that other nations have.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Placeholder</h2>

<p>Picts are known for their abilities at stealth and concealment. Every Pict character is required to max out their Hiding skill at all times and is encouraged to invest points in similar skills. Picts are notorious for their ambushing abilities, and often their foes don't even realize the danger until the fight has already begun.</p>


<h2>Rules</h2>

<p>Shadowclan Pict always remain in character in all chat channels. The only exceptions allowed are in private tells.
