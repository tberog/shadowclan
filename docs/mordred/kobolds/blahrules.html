  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Do not use guild 
      chat to find groups. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To look for a learning group, use /gc who to find people relatively near you age and speak with them directly or through your Klomp Rank chat group. 
      If a large trip is in progress, use the chat group for the trip. If you 
      are already near the Horde and need to be added to a group, use /say or 
      /yell.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Do not use guild 
      chat to run your group or trip. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">U</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">se

    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFFFF">Do not 
      ask on guild chat if someone can add a new member. </font>Most Nobs are 
      busy enough that they'll miss the message. Use <i>/gc who</i>, find which 
      Nobs are awake, and <i>/send</i> them your request privately.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFFFF">Do 
      not use ALL CAPS on guild chat. </font>All-caps on guild chat is reserved 
      for Nobs and leaders of large raids, and even then only for important announcements 
      or emergencies. Getting ganked is not an emergency.</font></p>

      anything out of character (OOC) </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      over guild chat, such as realm points, item stats, specialization points, 
      experience points, amount of damage done, and the like. Even if you are 
      using kobo blah, discussion that is OOC in content is forbidden in all channels 
      except<i> /send</i>. Take all OOC discussions to <i>/send</i> or the message 
      boards.</font></p>
