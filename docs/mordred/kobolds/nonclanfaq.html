  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Neutral Kobolds may be tolerated 
      by the Shadowclan, sometimes group with Shadowclan members, and may seek 
      our protection.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You are a &quot;neutral Kobold&quot; 
      if you</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">are not a member of an enemy 
        guild (all members of enemy guilds are killed on sight)<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">are alone, or traveling only 
        with other neutral Kobolds<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">do not act in an aggressive 
        or insulting manner<br>
        </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Even neutral Kobolds should use 
      caution around the Shadowclan. If you are seen as a threat or your guild 
      is attacking us elsewhere, you will be attacked. If others arrive and a 
      fight breaks out, you may be seen as threatening and attacked, you may be 
      accidentally targeted, or you may fall within the range of our AOE spells. 
      If you truly want to be safe around the Shadowclan, join the Clan!</font></p>

  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font color="#FFFFFF">I'm 
    not a Kobold, but I like Shadowclan. Can I make friends with Shadowclan?</font></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> No. Shadowclan Kobolds are xenophobic 
      and do not make friends with members of other races. Other races will be 
      asked to pay tribute and then expected to leave the area. If you like us 
      and want to be around the Clan, make a Kobold character. Better yet, make 
      a Kobold character and join the Clan!</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font color="#FFFFFF">What 
    does &quot;tribute&quot; mean?</font></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If you're not a Kobold, and 
      you're not in an enemy guild, you will be asked to pay tribute.
      In a typical encounter, you'll be swarmed by a bunch 
      of kobolds, and probably either mezzed or rooted. They'll be screaming &quot;PAY 
      TRIBUT TU SHADUWKLAN!&quot; and other variations.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font color="#FFFFFF">How 
    do I pay the tribute?</font></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Do not act threatening, or you'll 
      be attacked. Don't move, even if mez wears off! Do not sit down or run away. Look for the 	kobold standing 
      right in front of you, pay him something, and wait for a moment to make 
      sure the kobolds are satisfied. Until the other kobolds know you paid, if 
      you try to leave, they'll think you're trying to escape, and they'll attack. 
      Don't move until you hear the kobolds start yelling &quot;HOOOOWAH TRIBUT!&quot; 
      and various other things.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font color="#FFFFFF">How 
    much tribute do I have to pay?</font></font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> It doesn't have to be much, 
      far less than buying back con. You can offer money or an item. If you are 
      poor, just give whatever you can. Of course, if you're high level, and pay 
      us a few copper, that will be insulting and we'll kill you. Standard fee is approximately the cost of one point of constitution, but we enjoy roleplaying. A shiny rock given as tribute can make an enjoyable encounter for everyone.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font color="#FFFFFF">Can 
    I hang around after I pay tribute?</font></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> No. Once you've paid, get out 
      of the area. Your tribute allows you to pass through the area alive, that's 
      all. Non-Kobolds are not allowed to hang around Shadowclan, no 
      matter how much tribute they pay. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font color="#FFFFFF">Why 
    was I asked to pay tribute again?</font></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Paying tribute does not make 
      you a friend. If you encounter more than one group of Shadowclan, you may need to pay tribute to both groups.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font color="#FFFFFF">Why 
    didn't I get a chance to pay tribute?</font></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> If you appear to be a threat, 
      you will be attacked rather than asked to pay tribute. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You will be seen as a threat 
      if you</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">are a member of an enemy guild<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">travel with members of enemy 
        guilds</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">have recently attacked Clan 
        members </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">behave in an aggressive or 
        insulting manner<br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">begin to cast a spell or run</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
        </font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">do not leave the area after 
        paying tribute<br>
        </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You may also be seen as a threat 
      for other reasons, such as being high level, traveling in a large group, 
      or traveling with enchanter pets.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When encountering the Shadowclan, 
      you can increase your chances of survival if you immediately yell &quot;I 
      PAY TRIBUTE&quot; and act non-threatening (do not move, ready your weapon, 
      or cast spells).</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> <font color="#FFFFFF">Why 
    is my guild on Shadowclan's enemy list?</font></font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Guilds whose members consistently 
      attack Shadowclan members are put on our enemy list. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How can my guild 
    be removed from Shadowclan's enemy list?</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Guilds who stop attacking our 
      members and approach Shadowclan in game may be removed from our enemy list. Note that we do not resolve such issues out of game; you must approach us in game, and negotiations will take place from there. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What should I do 
    if a Shadowclan member does not seem to be acting in accordance with Shadowclan 
    rules?</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Shadowclan enforces its rules 
      among its members. If you believe a Shadowclan member is breaking Shadowclan 
      rules, please report the incident to one of our officers (called &quot;Nobs&quot;).</font></p>
