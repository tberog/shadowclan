  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="+2" color="#FFCC33">Why 
    Join Shadowclan?</font></font> </p>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You came to Mordred 
    to battle, right?&nbsp; Then fight for a cause!&nbsp; Shadowclan provides 
    a context, something worth fighting for.&nbsp;&nbsp; It does this through 
    an immersive roleplaying experience, a large membership community, communal 
    sharing of equipment and supplies, members committed to helping each other 
    out, a strong desire for group combat, and a mature membership dedicated to 
    having fun while not ruining the fun of others.</font> 
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We are open membership, 
    so joining is easy.&nbsp; Try out Shadowclan - hundreds have and hundreds 
    have loved it!</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    &nbsp; </font> 
  <p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="+2" color="#FFCC33">Here 
    is how you join</font></font> 
  <ol>
    <li><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Read about our 
      <font color="#FFFFFF">language</font> and <font color="#FFFFFF">what we 
      expect</font> of members.<br>
      <br>
      </font></li>

      with </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">an <a href="names.html">appropriate 
      name</a>, and then immediately type /gc quit. This will take you out of the newbie guild all Mordred characters start in.</font><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
      <br>
      </font></li>
    <li><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Log in and </font><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">immediately</font><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      type <i>/who shadowclan</i> to get a list of who is online.&nbsp; <i>/send</i>&nbsp; 
      a message to one of them asking to be put in touch with a Nob so that you 
      can check your name. Although the Nob will be unable to invite you until your two hour guild change timer is up, it is best to check that your name will be accepted first.<br>
      <br>
      </font></li>
    <li><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use the /played command... when it read four hours, contact a Nob to invite you. The Nob will ask a few questions to make sure you 
      know what is expected of you and that you know some basic kobold words, than probably request you enter the zone he is in.</font></li>
  </ol>
  <p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's it!&nbsp; 
    Told you it was easy.</font> 
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#CCCCCC">Make sure to:</font>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Get in touch 
      with a Nob as soon as possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
      because if your name is not approved or if you are above level 20, you will 
      have to make a new character to join Shadowclan (and this is less painful 
      if you are low level). <a href="noblist.php" target="_blank">Click here 
      for a list of Nob names.</a></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Keep your safety 
      flag on.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> All Shadowclan 
      members are strongly advised to keep their safety flags on and remain PvP- 
      as long as they can, all the way to level 10.<br>
