<font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="+2" color="#FF9900">Tribes of Shadowclan</font>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shadowclan is divided into tribes, each run by one or more 
tribe leaders (Nobs). Nobs have authority over members of their own tribe. The 
tribes are united under the war leader (Wargoth) who is periodically selected in 
a ritual battle to the death between candidates from each tribe. The tribes are 
also united under the leaders of Shadowclan (Clangoths).</font>

<font size="+2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pomdung Tribe</font>   
<p><font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Pomdung tribe 
members (called pomdus) have just emerged from the underground to join 
Shadowclan on the surface. Pomdung Tribe is devoted to helping the new members 
adapt to the surface. It is named after Pomdung Ronkdug, the first kobold of 
Shadowclan to scout the surface for our invasion. Pomdung is believed to have 
been eaten by Njessi the sea monster.</font>

<p><font color="#CCCCCC">This is the tribe for all members new to Shadowclan.</font>

	</li>
	<li><font color="#CCCCCC">Base of operation: Fort Veldon</font> </li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#CCCCCC">Due to often 
being in a confused state having recently emerged from underground, pomdus are 
considered lower in the chain of command than anyone else in Shadowclan, and 
should listen to what Grunds instruct them to do.</font>

<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#CCCCCC">Grundurz 
	Tribe members (called grunds) are the members of Shadowclan who, no longer 
	unfamiliar with the surface world, are focusing on survival and becoming 
	stronger. Grunds actively seek to make members of the clan stronger through 
	battle. This tribe was founded by Grundurz Globuurz, who, while alone 
	engaging a svartalf in battle, was killed by a band of wandering dwarves.

<p>	<font size="+2" color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bratugnag Tribe</font>   
<p>	<font color="#CCCCCC" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bratugnag is a 
	collection of rude, crude, and abrasive Kobolds (called Brats). They are often insulting to others, especially other Brats. Their 
	general philosophy on life is that the only way to know that you are truly 
	close to somebody is to be able to expose all their faults, send them 
	through the gauntlet, and still remain friends. A kobo with thin skin is 
	most likely weak in many other ways as well, and not worthy of the harsh 
	world we live in. As a result of this, Brats are naturally hard workers, and 
	are very competitive. If you're going to insult another for something, you 
	better be able to handle it yourself. Their arrogance generally leads to the 
	attitude that if you want something done right, you do it yourself.</font>

	came into being during a Wargoth Fest held at Fort Veldon. After a bloody 
	and violent demonstration of their skills, the Burzulti looked to the 
	Clangoth and demanded to be recognized as an official tribe. The entire clan
