  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> Do I have to get 
    my last name approved before I go to the registrar?</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> YES. You MUST get your last 
      name approved by a Nob BEFORE you go to the name registrar and get your 
      name. No exceptions!</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> What does a last 
    name represent in the Clan?</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Your last name is your family 
      name, representing the family of kobolds you belong to. A family may have 
      a special history (like being the first to emerge from the underground) 
      or special characteristics (like having red hair, or being great warriors). 
      All kobolds in a family share the same family name.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> When can I take 
    a last name?</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You must be a Grund to begin 
      seeking approval for your last name. Pomdungs may not take last names.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> Do I have to take 
    a last name?</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> No. You can remain without a 
      family for as long as you like.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> How can I find 
    out about existing families within the Clan?</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Family stories are posted on 
      our Onomastics message board. If you are looking to join 
      a family, start there to read the stories posted by the heads of the families.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">How 
    can I join an existing family and take their family name?</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You MUST first get permission 
      from that family. Some families accept people right away, while others might 
      want to get to know you better first, or even give you a quest to carry 
      out to prove your worth. Once you get permission from the family, contact 
      any Nob to get final approval.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> How can I start 
    a new family?</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You MUST have a Nob approve 
      the new family and its name.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To seek approval for a new family, 
      <font color="#FFFFFF">write a description of your family and post it on 
      the Onomastics message board</font>. Do not ask for family 
      name approval in tells in game.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your description does not need 
      to be long, but should answer the following questions:</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Will your family be open only 
        to a particular subset of classes or specialization paths?</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Does your family have a special 
        appearance such as hair color or facial characteristics?</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">What would you like people 
        to know about your family and its history?</font></li>
      <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">How open will you be to accepting 
        new members into your family? </font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The proposed name for your family 
      must be based on <a href="language.html#ancient_kobold">Old Kobold</a> vocabulary. 
      Kobold families treasure their ancient origins from deep in the underground, 
      so all family names are in the old language.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> What does that 
    mean, &quot;based on Old Kobold&quot;?</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> The new family name should incorporate 
      at least one word from the <a href="language.html#ancient_kobold">Old Kobold</a> 
      vocabulary list, and preferably should consist of a combination of words 
      from the list. The name must NOT sound like a human word or phrase.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here are some examples:</font></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Bugduzugh (call to the mountain 
        pass)<br>
        Talanuut (above the sky)<br>
        Gunduurzhai (stony people)<br>
        Gundobglob (fool made of stone)<br>
        Gimbubtak (will find them)<br>
        Fauthubnarkuu (will never lie hidden)<br>
        Krithduumpu (nine dooms)<br>
        Nuutghaash (sky-fire)<br>
        Dublugu (two towers)<br>
        Snagathrakurz (slave-bringers)<br>
        Throquuk (devour all)<br>
        Moglug (tower voice)</font></p>

  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> Skah! This sounds 
    hard! How can I get help picking a name for my kobold family?</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Others in the Clan will be glad 
      to help you come up with names! If you have an idea of your family and what 
      you want your family name to mean, post your ideas on the Onomastics message board, and others can help you try to &quot;translate&quot; 
      it into Kobold.</font></p>
