We test your readiness, and if       you are ready, we give you the opportunity to make a solemn oath to the       Clan and become a Grund.</font></p>  </blockquote>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> When am I ready     to take a Grund Test?</font></p>  <blockquote>     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You can take a Grund Test as       soon as you are Ash'Zuth rank (level 10) or older. If you are new to the       Clan, you may want to wait until you are a little more familiar with Clan       rules and culture, but don't wait too long. You should try to take your       Grund test by the time you are Ash'Krak rank (level 15).</font></p>  </blockquote>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> Once I am ready,     how can I take the test?</font></p>  <blockquote>     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Listen for an upcoming test       to be announced in the Clan blah (<i>/gu</i>) channel. <font color="#FFFFFF">Do       not harass testers by asking in a tell to be tested</font>; simply wait       for an announcement.</font></p>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When a test is announced, contact       the tester right away in <i>/send</i> so that they can add you to the test.       Tests are given in <i>/chat</i> groups, so if you are in a chat group already,       you will need to leave it first (using the <i>/cg leave</i> command) so       that you can be added to the chat group for the test.</font></p>  </blockquote>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> How can I do well     on the Grund test?</font></p>  <blockquote>     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Pay attention and follow directions.       Try not to put yourself in a situation where you will be distracted by fighting       or other conversations. You may want to find a hiding place or go to a safe       city during the test.</font></p>  </blockquote>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> Why didn't I pass     my Grund Test?</font></p>  <blockquote>     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> There are a number of possible       reasons for someone not to pass: not displaying adequate knowledge, not       paying attention, not following directions, not being present during part       of the test (if you are having linkdeaths or crashes), or having trouble       communicating. You don't have to have perfect language skills to pass, but       you need to be able to express yourself and understand others.</font></p>  </blockquote>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> What do I do if     I don't pass?</font></p>  <blockquote>     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> You can take the test again!       Just listen for another Grund Test to be announced. But first, make sure       to address the reason you didn't pass the first time, so that you make sure       to pass when you take it again.</font></p>  </blockquote>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF"> If I have more     than one character in Shadowclan, does each one have to take the test?</font></p>  <blockquote>     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Yes, you must take the test       with every one of your characters who becomes eligible. Each character is       treated as an individual, and has his own individual journey through the       various ranks and tribes in the Clan. We don't keep track of people's alts,       and frankly, we don't even want to know!</font></p>  </blockquote>  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">I've been waiting     to get tested, but Ihaven't heard a test announced. What should I do?</font></p>  <blockquote>     <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While you are levels 10-15, you       should be actively listening on the guild chat channel for Grund Tests.</font></p>    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you have not heard a test       announced <font color="#FFFFFF">and you are over 15</font>, don't panic,       but try to get tested as soon as possible.
