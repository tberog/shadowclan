  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2" color="#999999">Underground 
    Kobold Origin Story</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the inception of the three 
    realms there has existed two worlds. Neither the surface dwellers nor those 
    in the deep underground knew that the other existed, and this was the state 
    of things untill recently. Reality as defined by the underworld inhabitants 
    had always begun at the core of the earth, and ended several hundred miles 
    short of the deepest surface caves that were, as of this point, unexplored. 
    Birag'tuek, the name of the place called home by the dark kobolds also housed 
    several other sentient races including the dark dwarves and the trolls.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Because of the harsh conditions 
    beneath the earth's crust, resources were hard to come by, and not in enough 
    quantity to support the now burgeoning races. Peace was easy to maintain when 
    the three races where young and of small number, but with all three groups 
    growing in size and complexity, tensions began to mount. Eventually war broke 
    out between the trolls and kobolds as they occupied similar areas and were 
    in the most direct competition with one another.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At this point, roughly 500 years 
    from the present, a kobold warrior culture emerged. The kobolds, being weaker 
    but far more crafty than the trolls managed to outmaneuver the superior troll 
    armies and eventualy succeded in pushing them up into the outer reaches of 
    Birag'tuek. Those trolls who stayed or were captured became slaves. After 
    the first great war a period of peace ensued for about 100 to 120 years where 
    the kobolds were free to expand and grow in the spaces previously occupied 
    by the trolls. Resistance forces and freedom forces where a constant threat, 
    and conflict was a daily routine for the Kobolds. Throughout this time the 
    ancient kobolds developed the majority of their warrior culture, religion 
    and political structure.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">These ancient Kobolds determined 
    themselves to be the chosen race of Herga (In kobold means the Warrior father), 
    and determined that their strengths and powers come from themselves and the 
    earth to submit all those in existance to the Kerchat (divine order). The 
    divine order called for the Kobolds to control all of Herga's creation as 
    only they have the capacity to care for it properly, and that all other races 
    must either submit as slaves or be killed. Also, Kerchat treats all kobolds 
    as a single being that eminates from Herga. The kobolds believe that they 
    make up the earthly body of their god, and that this body, in order to function, 
    must exist as a unified force in the world. So in some sense, there is a trinity 
    of caretaker, conqurer and divinity in the principles of Kerchat followed 
    by underworld kobolds. This suggests that submission to the horde should yield 
    one not of that race to be spared, and this is indeed the case. Though kobolds 
    see other races as far inferior to their own, they will not kill for sport.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The kobolds of the underworld were 
    governed by a single council of generals. According to the principles of Kerchat, 
    both magic and the ability to fight stem from the same source and are therefore 
    different expressions of the same thing; the force of Herga. This council 
    was therefore populated by the oldest and most respected warriors and magicians.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Subsequent to the revelation of 
    Kihagh (the faith (aka bloodlust)), a holy war ensued with the dark dwarves 
    who had, for some time lived without the need to fight major battles. The 
    result was complete subjugation of the dwarf race with a portion of the dwarves 
    fleeing to the banished zone in the upper reaches of Birag'tuek. At this point 
    in time the Kobold civilization was massive and thriving, with huge cities 
    twice the size of any that existed on the surface, expanding ever deeper into 
    the core of Birag'tuek.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The outer underworld, on the other 
    hand, was populated by primitive groups of dark trolls, small armed settlements 
    of dark dwarves, and the occasional roving band of outcast Kobolds -- for 
    not all Kobolds heard the voice of Herga and followed the unifying principles 
    of Kerchat. From time to time, the great Kobold civilization sent forces into 
    the upper zones to capture and punish the degenerate Kobolds, and to keep 
    the other races from growing stronger.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Humans and surface dwarves began 
    to mine the earth for its metals and minerals. Some of these mines reached 
    deep, near the upper parts of Birag'tuek, and thus began the era of human 
    encounters with the inhabitants of the underworld. Each of the underworld 
    races reacted differently. The dark Trolls reacted with simple, uncoordinated 
    violence. The dark dwarves reacted by withdrawing even more completely into 
    their small, fortified settlements. The outcast Kobolds, fitting their native 
    craftiness, began to shadow the Humans, steal from them, and cause trouble.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some bands of these outcast Kobolds 
    were so weak and unable to fend for themselves in the dark underworld that 
    they became dependent on following and stealing from Humans, and developed 
    an uneasy pariah relationship. Like domesticated dogs, the once independent 
    outcast Kobolds became pathetic followers of the Humans, sneaking around their 
    settlements, sometimes stealing, and sometimes even doing chores for the humans 
    in exchange for scraps. Others became enslaved by Humans and surface dwarves 
    in the mines. These degenerate, weak Kobolds are the ancestors of today's 
    surface Kobolds.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Meanwhile, the great Kobold civilization 
    had burrowed even deeper into the earth, and had become more self-absorbed. 
    Its military forces, sent rarely now into the upper zones, had to take longer 
    and longer journeys to accomplish their missions and return to the deep homeland 
    -- generations in many cases, because of the sheer vastness of the underworld. 
    These forces became more self sufficient, forming a social structure of nomadic 
    tribes, with both male and female warriors and magicians. Yet unlike the degenerate 
    surface Kobolds, these clans stayed true to the principles of Kerchat. We, 
    the Shadowclan, began as one of these military clans.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">No one knows why the great underground 
    eruptions occurred, if they were natural, or stemmed from some magical source 
    or accident. All we know is that their effects were huge, cutting off the 
    deepest parts of Birag'tuek from the upper zones, and causing terrible destruction 
    in the middle zones, where we were stationed. Surely the great civilization 
    of the underground Kobolds is not gone, for Herga would not allow such a terrible 
    thing; but we have no more contact with it. Surely there are other military 
    Clans that were cut off as we were, or lost Kobolds from such clans, that 
    we may join with in order to carry out our joint mission. We must find these 
    lost Kobolds, subjugate and conquer the surface world, and then find a way 
    to rejoin our great civilization.<br>
