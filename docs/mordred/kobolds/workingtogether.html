  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
    <font color="#FF9900" size="+2">Working Together</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Shadowclan members always work 
    together, whether we are hunting creatures, defending our territory, extracting 
    tribute, or battling our enemies.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We <font color="#FFFFFF">group 
      with other Shadowclan kobolds</font>. Occasionally we may do 
      some task or quest alone, or group with friendly non-Shadowclan kobolds. 
      We never group with the weak and untrustworthy lesser races (non-kobolds).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We <font color="#FFFFFF">join 
      together as a Horde</font> to hunt fearsome beasts, to raid and subdue 
      enemy territory, and to explore. Our <a href="#hordetrips">Horde Trips</a> are led by our 
      wargoth, Nobs, and other trip leaders.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We <font color="#FFFFFF">always 
      observe discipline</font>. This means that we always listen to Nobs and 
      trip leaders, and always follow their commands. Those who harm the Clan 
      by acting unruly and selfish may be disciplined by the Nobs, including being 
      demoted or kicked out of the Clan until they learn better behavior.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Always remember that our power 
    comes from the combined strength of many kobolds working in unison towards 
    common goals.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFFFF">Never turn 
      away another Clan member</font>. If eight clan members are hunting together 
      and a ninth shows up, split into two groups to accommodate the newcomer.</font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="+2"></font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+2" color="#FFFFFF">Horde 
    Trips<a name="hordetrips"></a></font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A huge Horde of kobolds is powerful 
    when it works together as a unit, and running with the Horde can be an amazing 
    experience for all. However, it is a big challenge for even an experienced 
    and talented trip leader to manage a huge number of kobolds, so make the trip 
    leader's job easier and follow these Horde Rules.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the Horde is gathering together 
    and organizing into groups,</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Make sure to 
      be on time. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Late arrivals 
      create delay for everyone. If you have a distance to travel to the meeting 
      place, make sure to allow extra time in case you get killed on the way.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Form groups according 
      to the leader's orders</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. 
      Each leader has his own way of organizing groups, so listen carefully and 
      follow orders. When group formation proceeds in an orderly manner, the trip 
      can start much more quickly.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While the Horde Trip is underway,</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Pay attention 
      to everything said by the trip leader</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
      and immediately follow his commands. Keep an eye on him at all times and 
      make sure you see where he's going every time he moves.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Don't attack 
      without orders</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Allow the 
      trip leader to coordinate the group's attacks.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Use communication 
      channels wisely</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">. Use the 
      chat group for the trip, not guild chat. Don't clutter up the chat group. 
      Don't use all-caps, it distracts people from hearing the raid leader. Use /say or /yell for singing, cheering, otherwise making merry, or threatening pinkis.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">If you die</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">, 
      <i>/send</i> the trip leader. Don't pester him. Send him a quick &quot;Mih 
      flat at such-and-such-place.&quot; Make sure you include where you died. 
      This is the best way to make sure the trip leader knows somebody died.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF">Be patient and 
      understanding</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> if you died 
      and are waiting to be resurrected, or you are separated from the group and 
      waiting for them to come get you.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Finally,<font color="#FFFFFF"> 
      let the designated leader lead the trip</font>, even if the leader is not 
      high rank, or you don't like the way he is leading. It's better to follow 
      a so-so leader than to confuse everybody with who to listen to. Don't start 
      second guessing the leader and saying that he's wrong, and don't try to 
      co-lead unless the leader asks you specifically to do so. If the leader 
      is doing something very wrong, <i>/send</i> him a message to let him know.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Level and experience are not required to lead a trip, the clan encourages initiative. If you want to give feedback about how a Horde Trip 
    was organized and led, feel free to send a Nob a private message after the 
    trip. Avoid posting negative, unconstructive comments on the boards.</font></p>
