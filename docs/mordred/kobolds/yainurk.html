The snow ahead was undisturbed; none of the snow in the area was disturbed except for what lay behind her. To make matters worse the storm was worsening which would make finding Xakh harder. "Wir in da skah am dat mushidid kobo?" She muttered under her breath, she paused and blew into her paws and rubbed them together. "Hym kuld nub uv pikt a muur nubhosh tym tu hiid ub hiir alun." What Savikh saw in the kobold eluded her; although the gift of magic did run through his veins he could never make his mind up about what path to follow. "Skah iv hym flat owt hiir Savikh am gunna skalp mih." She pressed on and continued to climb the mountainside. Savikh’s final words before he left for the caves still rung in her head. "Kiip a guud wadj uvur Xakh fur mih Yain. Da skigudz huv bubhosh planz fur hym, agh in da muunz ahiid da klan wil niid hym muur din aniash kin gruk." 
<p>
Savikh always seemed to have the sight and he had been correct in his prediction that the clan would fall on hard times. There were very few of the older kobolds left and the clan had lost much of its former strength. Besides just how was she supposed to keep an eye on Xakh when he took to the hills every chance he got? She scanned the terrain ahead with no luck. The haste magic she had received at the gates to Yggdra forest was wearing off. "Wil dis am az guud a plaz az ani mih gruk."
<p>
She wielded the staff in her left paw, she loved this staff, her good friend Draagu had worked very hard to make it for her and it had become apart of her in the passing months. Kuzzat had then used her remarkable skills to imbue the staff with arcane magics to aid her. Kuzzat had also imbued all of her armor for her; she rubbed the cloth of her vest and remembered Kuzzat fondly. She was closer to Kuzzat than she was to even her own sisters and brother. "Skah mih mizz Kuzzat." She muttered as she prepared to summon the bones. 
<p>
She had been able to wield magic for as long as she could remember and had chosen the path of the bonedancer many years ago. But summoning them always filled her with a sense of awe. She opened her self up to the magics and fell into a slight trance. Waves of power surged through her and in a mater of moments a dread commander stood before her. "Skah zult kommandur." She muttered with some anger, she never understood why she could not summon a commander with the weapon she wanted. "Zults am nub ani guud owt hiir mushiid." She said to the commander, who just stood there and looked at her with empty eye sockets. She released the commander to the either and prepared to summon another. She cast the spell again and in moments a new commander stood before her. "Ahhh a dub paw womp ash, bubhosh!" Hammers seemed to work best against the creatures that roamed the forests here. She again opened herself to the magics and summoned a guardian, which began to cast its own spells as she summoned the third and final pet, a healer. She then recast the shields that protected her from harm to freshen them up. 
<p>
She then quaffed a potion of rejuvenation that Moogy had made for her and felt its power rush through her. "ahhh Moogy mih mizz lats wurm faz riyt nuw." She had begun to fall in love with the assassin and potion maker of the clan. She had long ago promised herself that she would not fall for a fellow clan member for it was safer to not mix love and war, but over passing months Moogy had been a great friend and always treated her well. She shook her head. "Skah mih gittin sydtrakt wif diz silli gruks uv luv!" She began her search for Xakh in the snow again with her small army of skeletons following behind her. 
<p>
She pressed on up the mountain for another hour and came upon the bone eater oracle camp. She traveled along the edge of the camp keeping her eyes open for Xakh and trouble. Normally where ever Xakh was trouble was sure to be nearby. She circled the camp and found no sign Xakh; at this point her anger with Xakh was beginning to turn to worry. He was nowhere to be found and she had begun to fear to worst. Not only were there unfriendly creatures and pinkis up here, but also an enemy controlled keep was nearby and Xakh would be no match for its guard patrols. As she looked around for Xakh she remembered a new spot that he had found recently that he wanted to show her, something about large ice creatures.. She smiled, "dats wir hym am, ad da izs shurd kamp!" she said out loud and she ran in the direction of the spot he had described hoping that her sense of direction was true. 
<p>
As she made her way to where she remembered seeing ice shards, she heard voices. Her heart stopped and then started beating fast, one sounded like a troll and the other was a human, but she could not see them in the blowing snow, and the wind made finding the direction hard. She scanned ahead and made her way slowly. Suddenly the wind died down for a moment and she could make out the troll, human,and Xakh! Her understanding of pinki speech was poor, but she knew enough to understand that they meant to toy with him before killing him. Her face grew hot as the anger boiled up in her. She commanded her skeleton to attack the human. "LIV HYM ALUN!!!!" She bellowed as she charged up on the group and began casting a spell at the troll. The troll and human were caught off guard by the sudden fury of movement and the angry voice from behind them. They spun around to find themselves being charged not by one kobold, but a kobold and 3 skeletons. In the space of time between when they spun and Yainurks first spell took hold on the troll the look on both of their faces filled her with a sense of hope. The look of utter despair is the same no mater what race you are. The skeletons engaged the human and she began casting a second spell on the troll. The troll squared itself and let out a bellow, it raised a huge shield and a hammer and she was then struck with a bolt of lightning, the troll was a thane. At the last moment she turned toward the human cast a life tap at it and readied her staff. She engaged the human and cast another life tap; in a matter of moments the human lay dead at her feet. 
<p>
Things were quiet for what felt like an eternity, but reality came crashing down in the shape of a large hammer. The thane had hit her squarely in the middle of her back. "GID AWAI FRUM HIR!!!!" Xakh yelled from behind the troll and began to hit it with his staff, the troll paused for a moment, which was all Yainurk needed. Her Skeletons had turned to attack the troll and she cast a life tap at it while she swung her staff at it. "RUN XAKH RUN!!" She yelled as she engaged the troll, it turned its attention back on her and tried in vain to fight her off. 
<p>
As suddenly as it had started the battle was over, both the human and the troll lay dead at her feet. She turned her attention back to Xakh who stood a small distance away panting. As she looked at him her anger began to melt away, she walked over to him. "Am lat uki Xakh?" she asked. He just nodded, and looked past her at the two bodies lying in the snow. He then looked up at her and said. "Holi skah mih huup lat nivur git angiry wif mih Yain!" At this Yainurk broke out in laughter. "Mih gruk dat iv lat kum owt hiir agun wifowt mih lat myt fiil sum uv dat angur." A brief look of worry crossed Xakh’s face and then he grinned. Yainurk looked back at the 2 bodies in the snow and said. "Wil luuks lyk wih huvin pinki stu fur dinur dis muun!"
