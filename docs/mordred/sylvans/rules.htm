<h3 align=center>Rules:</h3>
<h4>General Rules</h4>
<p>
    * Stay in character, and speak Sylvan. You may go out of character in /tell if you need to.
    Being in-character is easy and has two parts - language and behavior.
<blockquote>
<p>
    The Hekili language is described in our <a href="language.htm"> language</a> sections.<br>
    <br>
    Shadowclan behavior means being extremely helpful to Shadowclan members, neutral to non-Hekili sylvans, and hostile to non-sylvans (especially humans, dwarves, and elves). Attack known enemies of Shadowclan or those who refuse to leave sylvan territory once warned.<br>
    You should only group with Shadowclan members and friendly non-Hekili
    sylvans.
</blockquote>
<p>
    * Group only with guild members and neutral sylvans, unless otherwise directed for events by an Ingwe (officer).<br>
    <br>
    * Follow all commands of any Ingwe, or trip leaders. Questions can be asked later, follow their commands first.<br>
    <br>
    * Choose appropriate last names as defined in our <a href="join.htm"> Member
    Guide</a>, only after
    joining an advanced tribe.<br>
    <br>
    * Members must dye armor appropriately as defined by there <a href="tribes.htm">tribe</a>.<br>
    <br>
    * Members must try to not ruin the fun of others. Only attack those who deserve to be attacked (for example - they are known enemies/traitors, they initiate combat, they refuse to leave sylvan territory, they refuse to follow sylvan orders on sylvan territory, they insult sylvans, they swear a lot). Be respectful of fellow players both in and out of the Shadowclan.<br>
    <br>
    * Hekili do not use /anon unless given express permission by an Ingwe.<br>
    <br>
    * Follow Mythic's rules. Hekili do not break the ToS, exploit known bugs, or farm realm points.<br>
    <br>
    * Hekili who have committed their character to an advanced <a href="tribes.htm"> tribe</a> (Laire, Yavie, or Hrive) are expected to stay in the guild. Characters that quit the guild after making the commitment are branded traitors and attacked on sight.<br>
<h4>
Rules of Engagement</h4>
<br>
In Hybrasil:<br>
<br>
    * Softskins (non-sylvans) are not allowed in Hybrasil. If found there, give them warning that they should leave, and if they stay kill them.<br>
    * Enemy guilds can and should be attacked wherever they are found. A <a href="http://www.shadowclan.org/darkmoot/viewtopic.php?t=26511">joint
list of guilds branded enemies of the Shadowclan alliance</a> is maintained by
the Kobolds in the <a href="http://www.shadowclan.org/darkmoot/viewforum.php?f=12">Mordred
Pomdu Pit</a>. No warning need be given to them, they are proven trespassers in the forest.<br>
    * Unguilded individuals are considered those not willing to show their affiliation. They should be treated as hostile; give them warning if they are not a threat (ie, grey-green, have their back turned talking to a merchant, have seen you but chosen not to attack.) If they are are a person traveling with a pet, your level or higher, or you otherwise think that giving them warning will get you killed, you may attack them without warning to evict them from the forest.<br>
<br>
Outside Hybrasil:<br>
<br>
    * Kill all members of enemy guilds you can. Leave members of neutral guilds alone unless attacked or threatened. Unguilded softskins are still hostile, follow the same rules as above.<br>
<br>
Everywhere:<br>
<br>
    * Hekili does not resurrect its enemies, instead allow their flesh to feed the earth and the forest. If a resurrection is given mistakenly, do not rez kill unless the softskin chooses to hang around when it is given the chance to leave the area.&nbsp;<br>
<h4>
Equipment Rules</h4>
<br>
    * All Hekili equipment and money is owned communally by the guild. Don't hoard for later. Share agressively with your guildmates, take intiative in getting things into the hands of people who can use them. Do not buy or sell from enemies. Do not waste the guild's money. If you need something, ask. Make sure to dye your armor the proper colors for your uniform, if you do not have dye money it will be provided.<br>
    * There are many crafters in Shadowclan. If you are in an advanced tribe, please try to help with costs of the crafted items. If you are a Tulie, then you will have to pay for your equipment materials after level 25 until you choose an advanced tribe.<!--msnavigation--></td></tr><!--msnavigation--></table></body>
