<h3 align=center>Tribes of the Hekili</h3>

<h4>Default Tribe:</h4> This tribe (the Tulie) will only be provided up to level 25 gear from the crafters; they also may not take a surname. If they want better gear they need to pass into adulthood as an elder aldar. When a member of this beginning tribe feels that they have reached adulthood, their next step is to find a mentor in the tribe they are interested in (between level 10-20 for non /level, 25 for /level). That mentor will teach them what they need to know and vouch for them when (s)he feels the sapling is ready to join an advanced tribe.
<blockquote>
  <h5>Tulie (Tribe of Spring):</h5>
      This is where all Sylvans start, the sylvan youth.&nbsp;<p>Spring brings new growth. These are youth of the Sylvans. These are the initiates who are testing there branches in the world. They strive towards learning more of the world and surviving in the evil world of humans. Eventually they will all grow old enough to join another grove and truly become a member of the Sylvan culture.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  A member of the Tulie tribe is colored all in brown signifying the soil they come from.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Advanced Tribes:</h4> Joining one of these requires an oath of allegiance to the clan for the life of the character. Only members of advanced tribes can take a surname. Surnames are either the name of the advanced tribe, or the name "Hekil". These members are full fledged members of the clan and have access to gear from the crafters for all levels.
<blockquote>
  <h5>Laire (Tribe of Summer):</h5>
 Summer is a time of warmth and companionship. This is the advanced RP tribe. They function as story tellers, lorekeepers, and interalliance RP event (i.e. wargames and the like) leaders. Strong RP is needed in all tribes, but this is for the most advanced RPers who are willing to teach others or start a story telling gathering. Crafters who spend the majority of their time crafting are also encouraged to join this tribe (hurray for captive audiences!).<br>
  The Laire are the historians, artisans, and artists. They keep track of the Hekili's accomplishments and lore. They enjoy creating ballads, poems, and pieces of art about the greater events of Hekili history. They give their wisdom and skill to the clan by teaching the lore to others and providing high quality goods.<br>
  <br>
  Members of the Laire tribe wear blue&nbsp; boots, signifying bardic heritage and the vast expanses of sky and water from which they gather their inspiration. A Laire Ingwe would also wear
  blue gloves.
<h5>
      Yavie (Tribe of Autumn):</h5>
  Autumn is a time of aging. This is the advanced PVE tribe. These sylvans that have grown wise with age and understand the troubles that can occur and they prefer staying within the homeland and protecting the Hekili's territory. They understand that preserving what they already have is perhaps the most important need of survival. They will also collect new and useful tools for survival. They are well known amongst the Sylvans for their profound wisdom and careful planning.
  They are also known as a kind of warrior-priest, as for sylvans the act of cleansing the land of their enemies is a religious act.<br>
  <br>
  Members of the Yavie tribe wear orange boots to signify the autumnal spirit they gain their strength from. A Yavie Ingwe would also wear
  orange gloves.
<h5>
      Hrive (Tribe of Winter):</h5>
      Winter is harsh and unforgiving. This is the tribe for the advanced PvPer's. Winter is harsh. Sylvans that have seen the world and understand the true evils of the outside world. They resent humans much more than other groves and even can find kobolds to be difficult to handle. Members of this tribe are much more likely to act aggresively towards the other races. However, they find a much stronger bond between other Sylvans and will always prefer to travel in large groups. They do relate with kobolds, but may never fully come to trust them.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Members of the Hrive tribe wear grey boots signifying the death and harshness of winter. A
  Hrive Ingwe would also wear grey gloves.
