			<P><I>Default Tribe:</I> This tribe (the Tulie) will only be provided up to level 25 gear from the crafters; they also may not take a surname. If they want better gear they need to pass into adulthood as an elder aldar. When a member of this beginning tribe feels that they have reached adulthood, their next step is to find a mentor in the tribe they are interested in (between level 10-20 for non /level, 25 for /level). That mentor will teach them what they need to know and vouch for them when (s)he feels the sapling is ready to join an advanced tribe.</P>

				This is where all Sylvans start, the sylvan youth.
			</UL>
			
				
			<P><I>Advanced Tribes:</I> Joining one of these requires an oath of allegiance to the clan for the life of the character. Only members of advanced tribes can take a surname. Surnames are either the name of the advanced tribe, or the  name "Hekil". These members are full fledged members of the clan and have access to gear from the crafters for all levels.</P>
			
			<UL>
				<B>Laire (Tribe of Summer):</B><BR>
				Summer is a time of warmth and companionship. This is the advanced RP tribe.<BR>
				<BR>
				<B>Yavie (Tribe of Autumn):</B><BR>
				Autumn is a time of aging. This is the advanced PVE tribe.<BR>
				<BR>
				<B>Hrive (Tribe of Winter):</B><BR>
