			<P><B>Background of the Hekili</B></P>
			<UL>
			 <li> Sylvans are very naturally minded and value the forests (especially Hybrasil) more then anything else.  
			 <li> Sylvans are slow spoken, yet intelligent (more so then kobos).  
			 <li> The older (higher level) you are, the more respect you garnor. The oldest are considered the most wise.  
			 <li> Intense hatred of Hibernians, especially celts and elves who have built cities. Distrust/dislike of all "human" races as they are all "industrial" minded.  
			</UL>
			  
			<P><B>Traits common in the majority of Sylvans:</B></P>
			<UL>
			 <li> Most of the Hekili tribe are affiliated with Winter/Fall functions and beliefs, having been outcast from the Sylvan Nation, however, a few have taken on the job of Summer functions (see <A HREF="tribes.html" target="SUB">Tribes</A>).  
			 <li> Many Sylvans have an intense dislike/fear of axes. Many others hate hammers and bows because of their noncombat uses and how they were created.  
			 <li> Many Sylvans flat out refuse to talk to non sylvans (other than kobo now) at all.
