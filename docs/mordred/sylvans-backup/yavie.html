			Autumn is a time of aging. These sylvans that have grown wise with age and understand the troubles that can occur and they prefer staying within the homeland and protecting the Hekili's territory. They understand that preserving what they already have is perhaps the most important need of survival. They will also collect new and useful tools for survival. They are well known amongst the Sylvans for their profound wisdom and careful planning. This is the "advanced" PVE tribe which PVE trip leaders will want to join. They are also known as a kind of warrior-priest, as for sylvans the act of cleansing the land of their enemies is a religious act.</P>
			<P>Members of the Yavie tribe wear orange boots and gloves to signify the autumnal spirit they gain their strength from.</P>
