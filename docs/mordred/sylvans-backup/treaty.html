			<P><B>Terms of the Shadowclan/Hekili Alliance (translated):</B></P>
			<P>1. Shadowclan & Hekili will fight together to curtail the infestation of humans and their ilk in the world. Outside of Hybrasil, Hekili will support the kobos in their taking of tribute from pinkis. In Hybrasil, Shadowclan will help clear the forest of all softskins, excepting those allowed specifically by Hekili.
			<P>2. Shadowclan & Hekili will share amongst themselves as they have to date within their current guilds, to facilitate the clearing of their enemies from the world. As such, a traitor to one guild is a traitor to the Alliance, for he has stolen from both.
			<P>2a. Hekili has agreed to form and administer a test to their makers, as the Shadowclan already gives to their own, to determine their suitability in helping to guide the alliance's economy.
			<P>3. Hekili will support Shadowclan in their taking, defense, and maintanence of keeps, on the condition that wood for door repairs and upgrades is either summoned magically or blessed by the sacrifice of Hekili blood.
			<P>4. Hekili & Shadowclan will maintain a joint enemy and neutral list, which shall be administrated by the Nobs & Ingwe, formed of those guilds who are suggested by elder members of both guilds. Those who refuse to show their clan affiliation will be considered hostile, as will any guild not appearing on the alliance's enemy or neutral lists.
			<P>5. Hekili & Shadowclan both reserve the right to close off access to their territory for ceremonies, religious rights, and other official occasions. They both reserve the right to have events only their guild may attend.
			<P>6. Shadowclan & Hekili members shall respect the orders of officers of the other guild, and bring any disagreement up through their own chain of command. In the case of the Hekili, this includes respecting the Wargoth's orders.
			<P>6a. Each guild will take the lead on it own territory - Hekili's wishes will be respected in Hybrasil, Shadowclan's in Midgard.
			<P>7. The alliance's emblem will not contain axes, or any other nature destoying chopping implements.
			<P>8. Hekili will be permitted in Shadowclan's upper caves (Kobotown) for crafting, item storage, etc, however the caves/huts remain Shadowclan property. The land around the caves is Hekili's to garden as they wish.<br>&nbsp;</P>
