			<P><B>Laire (Tribe of Summer):</B><BR>
			Summer is a time of warmth and companionship. This is the advanced RP tribe. They function as story tellers, lorekeepers, and interalliance RP event (i.e. wargames and the like) leaders. Strong RP is needed in all tribes, but this is for the most advanced RPers who are willing to teach others or start a story telling gathering. Crafters who spend the majority of their time crafting are also encouraged to join this tribe (hurray for captive audiences!).<br>
			The Laire are the historians, artisans, and artists. They keep track of the Hekili's accomplishments and lore. They enjoy creating ballads, poems, and pieces of art about the greater events of Hekili history. They give their wisdom and skill to the clan by teaching the lore to others and providing high quality goods.</P>
			<P>Members of the Laire tribe wear blue gloves and boots, signifying bardic heritage and the vast expanses of sky and water from which they gather their inspiration.</P>
