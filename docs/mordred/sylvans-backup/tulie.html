			<P><B>Tulie (Tribe of Spring):</B><BR> 
			Spring brings new growth. These are youth of the Sylvans. These are the initiates who are testing there branches in the world. They strive towards learning more of the world and surviving in the evil world of humans. Eventually they will all grow old enough to join another grove and truly become a member of the Sylvan culture. When they are prepared for this step they must find a mentor in the tribe they are interested in (between level 10-20 for non /level, 25 for /level). That mentor will teach them what they need to know and vouch for them when (s)he feels the sapling is ready to join an advanced tribe. Tulie tribe members are unconfirmed members and thus can only have up to level 25 gear crafted for them by the guild.</P>
			<P>A member of the Tulie tribe is colored all in brown signifying the soil they come from.</P>
