			<P><B>General Rules</B></P>
			<UL>
				<LI>Stay in character, and speak Sylvan. You may go out of character in /tell if you need to.<BR> 
				<LI>Group only with guild members and neutral sylvans, unless otherwise directed for events by an Ingwe (officer).<BR>
				<LI>Follow all commands of any Ingwe, or trip leaders. Questions can be asked later, follow their commands first.<BR>
				<LI>Hekili do not use /anon unless given express permission by an Ingwe.<BR> 
				<LI>Follow Mythic's rules. Hekili do not break the ToS, exploit known bugs, or farm realm points. 
				<LI>Hekili who have committed their character to an advanced tribe (Laire, Yavie, or Hrive) are expected to stay in the guild. Characters that quit the guild after making the commitment are branded traitors and attacked on sight.<BR>
			</UL>
			
			<P><B>Rules of Engagement</B></P>
			<P>In Hybrasil:
			<UL>
				<LI>Softskins (non-sylvans) are not allowed on the Hybrasil. If found there, give them warning that they should leave, and if they stay kill them.<BR>
				<LI>Enemy guilds can and should be attacked wherever they are found. There will be a list of enemy guilds on the <A HREF="http://www.shadowclan.org/darkmoot/viewforum.php?f=76" target="_new">Tulie Thicket</A>. No warning need be given to them, they are proven trespassers on the forest.<BR>
				<LI>Unguilded individuals are considered those not willing to show their affiliation. They should be treated as hostile; give them warning if they are not a threat (ie, grey-green, have their back turned talking to a merchant, have seen you but chosen not to attack.) If they are are a person traveling with a pet, your level or higher, or you otherwise think that giving them warning will get you killed, you may attack them without warning to evict them from the forest.<BR> 
			</UL> 
			
			<P>Outside Hybrasil: 
			<UL>
				<LI>Kill all members of enemy guilds you can. Leave members of neutral guilds alone unless attacked or threatened. Unguilded softskins are still hostile, follow the same rules as above. <BR>
			</UL>
			
			<P>Everywhere:
			<UL> 
				<LI>Hekili does not resurrect its enemies, instead allow their flesh to feed the earth and the forest. If a resurrection is given mistakenly, do not rez kill unless the softskin chooses to hang around when it is given the chance to leave the area.
			</UL>
			
			<P><B>Equipment Rules</B></P>
			<UL> 
				<LI>All Shadowclan equipment and money is owned communally by the guild. Don't hoard for later. Share agressively with your guildmates, take intiative in getting things into the hands of people who can use them. Do not buy or sell from enemies. Do not waste the guild's money. If you need something, ask. Make sure to dye your armor the proper colors for your uniform, if you do not have dye money it will be provided.<BR> 
				<LI>There are many crafters in Shadowclan. If you are in an advanced tribe, please try to help with costs of the crafted items. If you are a Tulie, then you will have to pay for your equipment materials after level 25 until you choose an advanced tribe.
