			Winter is harsh. Sylvans that have seen the world and understand the true evils of the outside world. They resent humans much more than other groves and even can find kobolds to be difficult to handle. Members of this tribe are much more likely to act aggresively towards the other races. However, they find a much stronger bond between other Sylvans and will always prefer to travel in large groups. They do relate with kobolds, but may never fully come to trust them. This is the tribe for the RP PvPer's in the clan.</P>
			<P>Members of the Hrive tribe wear grey boots and gloves signifying the death and harshness of winter.</P>
