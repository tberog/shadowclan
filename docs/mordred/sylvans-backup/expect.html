		  <P><b>What We Expect of Members</b></P>
		  <P>Members must be <font color="#FFFFFF">in-character</font> at all times.&nbsp; The only exception is <i>/send</i> which can be OOC if necessary. Being in-character is easy and has two parts - language and behavior.</P>
		  <blockquote>
		    <p>The Hekili language is described in our <A HREF="full_language.html" target="SUB">language</A> sections.</p>
		    <p><font color="#FFFFFF">Shadowclan behavior</font> means being extremely helpful to Shadowclan members, neutral to non-Hekili sylvans, and hostile to non-sylvans (especially humans, dwarves, and elves).  Attack known enemies of Shadowclan or those who refuse to leave sylvan territory once warned.<BR> 
		    You should only group with Shadowclan members and friendly non-Hekili sylvans.</p>
		  </blockquote>
		  <p>Members must <font color="#FFFFFF">follow the chain of command</font> as defined in our Member Guide.</P>
		  <p>Members must choose <font color="#FFFFFF">appropriate last names</font> as defined in our Member Guide.</P>
		  <p>Members must <font color="#FFFFFF">dye armor appropriately</font> as <A HREF="uniform.html" target="SUB">defined</A> in our Member Guide.</P>
		  <p>Members must try to <font color="#FFFFFF">not ruin the fun of others</font>. Only attack those who deserve to be attacked (for example - they are known enemies/traitors, they initiate combat, they refuse to leave sylvan territory, they refuse to follow sylvan orders on sylvan territory, they insult sylvans, they swear a lot). Be respectful of fellow players both in and out of the Shadowclan.</P>
		  <p>Members must <font color="#FFFFFF">never intentionally break the Terms of Service</font> of the game or exploit bugs.</P>
		  <p>Members never go /anon unless given express permission by an Ingwe.</P> 
	      	  <p>Members who have committed their character to the Shadowclan must <font color="#FFFFFF">keep their character in the guild</font>.  Characters that quit the guild after making the commitment are branded traitors and attacked on sight.</P>
