			<P><b>How To Join:</b></P>

			<P>Read about our language and what we expect of members.</P>
			
			<P>Make a sylvan with an appropriate name, and then immediately type /gc quit. This will take you out of the newbie guild all Mordred characters start in.</P>
			
			<P><b>Naming Rules:</b></P>
			<ul>
				<u>First name:</u><br>
				Non English Sounding <BR>
				NO C's <BR>
				Should either be nearly directly from Ancient <A HREF="http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/qlist.htm">Quenya</A> (allowing some flexibility with how words are joined), or not have a specific meaning but contain a double (repeated) vowel and be very strictly non english sounding. 
				<BR>
				<u>Second name:</u> <BR>
				After you join an advanced tribe you are allowed to take a last name of either your tribe name or "Hekil".
			</ul>
			
			<P>Log in and immediately type /who Shadowclan to get a list of who is online. Next /send a message to one of them asking to be put in touch with an Ingwe so that you can check your name. Although the Ingwe will be unable to invite you until your two hour guild change timer is up, it is best to check that your name will be accepted first.</P>
			
			<P>Use the /played command... when it read two hours, contact an Ingwe to invite you. The Ingwe will ask a few questions to make sure you know what is expected of you and that you know some basic sylvan words, than probably request you enter the zone he/she is in.</P>
			
			<P><b>Make sure to:</b></P>
			<P>Get in touch with an Ingwe as soon as possible, because if your name is not approved or if you are above level 20, you will have to make a new character to join Shadowclan (and this is less painful if you are low level).</P>
			<P>Keep your safety flag on. All Hekili members are strongly advised to keep their safety flags on and remain PvP- as long as they can, all the way to level 10.</P>
