<b>Why join Shadowclan?</b><br><br>

You came to Ryzom to have fun while having an impact on the world and the storyline, right? Shadowclan provides a cause, something worth fighting for. It does so through an immersive roleplaying experience, communal sharing of equipment and supplies, members committed to helping each other out, a strong desire for group combat, and a mature membership dedicated to having fun while not ruining the fun of others.



<br><br><b>How to Join</b><br><br>


1. Read about our language and what we expect of members.<br><br>


2. Make a fyros character on the Windermeer (North American) server with an appropriate name.<br><br>

Naming Rules:<br>

Names must not sound meaningful in English or any other common language.
As our language is based on Latin, names from Latin or languages deriving from it, are encouraged.<br><br>



3. As soon as possible, make contact with one of our Proconsuls in-game. Once you arrive to the mainland, the Proconsul will want to meet you and ask you a few questions to make sure you know what is expected of you and that you have a basic understanding of our language.<br><br>


Make sure to: 

Get in touch with a proconsul as soon as possible, because if your name is not approved or if you are above level 50 in any skill, you will probably have to make a new character to join Shadowclan.
