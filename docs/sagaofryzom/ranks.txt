Guild recruitment and rank rules <br><br>

***********************NOVUS************************************** <br><br>

Requirements for joining as a probationary member: <br><br>

New member must be questioned and examined avatar to avatar by a guild officer. <br><br>

1. The recruit must be a Fyros with an appropriate Fyros name (which for now means no immersion breaking names). <br><br>

2. The recruit must present him/herself to the officer, wearing only Fyros garb and make a reasonable effort to speak in our language. <br><br>

3. The recruit should have recently come from the refugee island, have gained the title of Forager Apprentice and one other Apprentice title, and not yet reached the 50th rank in any skill. The recruit must not have previously been in another guild. Those of higher than 50 in any skill can still join but will then have to special and more demanding requirements. <br><br>

4. The recruit should demonstrate to the officer through questioning that they understand all the core guild rules. <br><br>

If all four criteria are met the recruit will join the guild as a probationary member, if not he/she will be turned away. Probationary members are expected to follow all the guild rules as any other member, except that they if they so choose can leave the guild without being branded traitors. The probationary status cannot be held forever: new members must become full members before reaching 100 in any skill or leave Shadowclan. <br><br>

Probationary members use Red and/or Tan armour pieces, and all their equipment must be of standard quality, not medium or high. <br><br>

***************************COMPAR********************************** <br><br>

Requirement for becoming a full Member: <br><br>

1. Must have been a probationary member for at least a week. <br><br>

2. Must have earned the title of Forager and at least one of the following: Melee Warrior, Range Fighter, Defensive Magician and Offensive Magician. <br><br>

3. Must be in good standing in the guild having adhered to the guild rules and culture while a probationary member. <br><br>

4. Must get the endorsement of three full members of Shadowclan affirming their belief that the probationary member will be a good addition to the guild ranks and not betray their oath to Shadowclan. <br><br>

5. With all of the four steps satisfied a probationary member may approach a guild officer for a trial of passage. A task/quest appropriate for the prospective member's abilities and future role in the guild will be given. Once the quest is completed a ceremony will be held where the questee gives his/her oath of allegiance, and once the officer has declared the questee a full member a grand old Shadowclan feast is held. <br><br>

Full members may not leave the Shadowclan, those that give or sell their account to someone else will be required to delete all their Shadowclan characters. Those that take their full member character out of Shadowclan or give/sell their account to someone else without deleting their Shadowclan character will be branded traitors. <br><br>

Full members use Red and/or Black armour pieces and may use equipment of medium or high quality if available.<br><br>

Rules regarding making a member of a character not "born into the guild": <br><br>

Circumstances where this would occur is deemed to be exceptional and not the norm, the prospective member would have to meet all the requirements to become a probationary member other than requirement #3. In addition to that the prospective member must: <br><br>

1. Get the endorsement of three Shadowclan members (the endorsements for full membership being separate and must come from three different members should the prospective member make it that far in the process). <br><br>

2. Make an appeal to join to the guild leader or a high officer. These will thoroughly question the prospective member on their motivation to join and their understanding of the rules and culture of Shadowclan. <br><br>

3. Pass the judgment of the entire Shadowclan council. The prospective member's application will be put to a vote by all the guild officers. For the Prospective member to become a probationary member of Shadowclan the vote must be unanimous in favour. Should there be a majority against, the application is rejected. If there is a minority against, those who voted against the application will formulate a set of conditions to be met by the applicant whereby they would be willing to change their vote. If the applicant meets those conditions he/she is permitted to join as a probationary member.
