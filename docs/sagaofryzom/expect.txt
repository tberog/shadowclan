New members start at Novus rank. Novus are inexperienced but eager members of our clan who try to learn our ways and respect our elders. <br><br>


<b>What is expected?</b><br><br>




Roleplaying<br><br>


Always be in-character and learn to use the basic Shadowclan language.<br><br>

Develop yourself a Fyros character with a persona which will be interesting for you to play and others to meet. What is he or she like? Fanatic or careful? Brave, loud, megalomanic, pyromantic, shrewd, perceptive, gullible, cruel, pacifist or a leader type? Have fun imaging and playing your character.<br><br>

Keep the game world and the real world apart. If you need to discuss things out-of-character, like matters of game mechanics, do so through /tell.<br><br>



Language<br><br>


You are expected to use our Basic language. All members are encouraged to learn more of the Shadowclan language.<br><br>



Cooperation<br><br>


We always prefer teaming with clannies, and we don't team with our enemies. Shadowclan strives to
optimize teamwork and cooperation in both PvE (player versus environment) and PvP (player versus player) combat.<br><br>



Shadowclan Property   <br><br> 


The Shadowclan economy might work differently from other guilds you may have encountered.<br><br>

All wealth and equipment is owned by the clan as a whole, not individuals - all things must remain inside Shadowclan. We rarely trade our items to other players. <br><br>

Shadowclan is very self sufficient. If you need to buy from other players, consult with officers or leaders first. Once you are Compar, Shadowclan will provide you with all you need.<br><br>

You are expected to donate all your excess wealth to Shadowclan, to help crafters with raw materials or become a crafter yourself. The Proconsuls are responsible for the appropriate distribution of our common wealth.<br><br>




Become Compar


As Novus you should try to learn more about Shadowclan. Our messageboard is a good place to learn and ask more.
Assuming you enjoy being part of Shadowclan, you will want to become Compar as soon as possible - full and committed member for life.
