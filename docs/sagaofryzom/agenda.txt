Where we come from?<br><br>


We come from the desert. During the Kitin Wars the mighty Fyros Empire was all but destroyed and its people scattered in the desert. We are now returning and trying to re-establish the Fyros power once more. <br><br>

Shadowclan is an old Fyros faction which once held many Proconsul seats within the old Imperium. We have always understood the importance of the Prime Roots, and again we are reaching for them.<br><br>

The Old Empire had many enemies, Matis being one of the greatest. Now Matis again present a threat to Fyros as they through new allies have grown in power.<br><br>



Where are we going?<br><br>


We must stand firm and trust only our own strength, as we have always. Ours is the destiny to forge the new face of Atys. Our strength comes from our brave spirit and strong traditions. But new threats have emerged since the days of the old Empire.<br><br>

Matis are now allied with Karavan, and this forces us to take sides in the conflict of the Ancients, the suspicious Kami and the controlling Karavan. As the Kami have prevented the Karavan from founding bases around Atys, they can restrict the aid Karavan can give to the Matis. This forces us to aid Kami, but never forget that your loyality is for Shadowclan first and Fyros second.<br><br>

We will not forget the Prime Roots and the Myth of the Dragon. Let our thoughts dwell on these matters as well.<br><br>
