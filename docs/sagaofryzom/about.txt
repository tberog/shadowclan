<h1>What Shadowclan is About</h1><br>

<b>Making the game more fun</b><br><br>

We have fun and increase the fun for others too.<br><br>

<b>Open Membership</b><br><br>

Anyone can make a Shadowclan fyros character and join.<br><br>

<b>Roleplay</b><br><br>We are always in-character while in-game.<br><br>

<b>Fiercely Independent</b><br><br>

Shadowclan follows and upholds fyros principles and their code of honor. We are hostile to Karavan and Matis followers, and wary of anyone not fyros. We are also very territorial.<br><br>
 

<b>Respect</b><br><br>

We respect other players as fellow players.<br><br>

<b>Quality</b><br><br>We train our members in the Shadowclan ways and our expectations are enforced.<br><br><b>Commitment</b><br><br>

In order to stay in Shadowclan after an initial trial period, members must permanently commit their character to Shadowclan.  Leaving Shadowclan  after becoming a full  member brands  your character  a traitor, and all of Shadowclan will shun not only your character but  also the next guild you might join. Further, you the player will not be allowed to join Shadowclan with any other character, in this or any other game.<br><br>

<b>Community</b><br><br>

Shadowclan members work together and share supplies freely among themselves.<br><br>

<b>Game Friendly</b><br><br>

Our storyline and background blend in with the game's storyline and background to the highest degree possible. We won't force other players to break character in order to match our own roleplay style. We follow the rules of the game. No cheating, bug exploiting, illegal 3rd party programs, or other violations of the game's Terms of Service are ever allowed.<br><br>

<b>Want to make an alternate character?</b><br><br>

Shadowclan is designed to not only be fun for someone's primary character, but also a great guild for alternate characters, offering an alternative style of playing the game that you rarely find in other guilds.<br><br>
