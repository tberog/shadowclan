<h1>Buurz'traga Tribe</h1>

<p>
Those who seek the Darkness. They are each driven by something, some don't even know by what, to the edge of insanity. Many embrace this insanity as the 'Darkness', where they will eventually find what they seek, one way or another.
</p>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
This is a group of orcs with their own internal 'demons'. Their ceremonies glory in the Darkness of insanity, endeavoring -- through the Darkness -- to find and reach the ultimate 'orchood'.
</p>
<p>
Some members are deceptively calm, and only through careful conversation with them could one reveal how twisted they truly are inside. With other members, it would be obvious - glaring even - that they are completely unhinged. Many fall between the two extremes.
</p>

<h2>Shirt</h2>
<p>
Orcs in this tribe wear black shirts.
</p>

<h2>Mount</h2>
<p>
Orcs in this tribe ride dire wolves.
