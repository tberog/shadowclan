<h3>Trolls</h3>

<p>Through the years of fighting and war, the noble, but ferocious orcs of the Shadowclan have been taking in troll orphans to help prepare for upcoming battles. Some orcs even bred with trolls to sire even more robust children.<br>
The children were carefully hidden away in the small mud huts of the breeder orcs and kept out of sight, so the Alliance would not know what they would face. The children of Shadowclan have begun to grow in numbers and power.</p>
<p>There will be a time when the trolls will join the ranks of the mighty army of the Shadowclan.</p>

<p><b>That time has come.</b></p>
