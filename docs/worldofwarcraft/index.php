 <h1>What Shadowclan is About</h1>


<h3>Making the game more fun</h3>
<p>
We have fun and increase the fun for others too.
</p>

<h3>Open Membership</h3>
<p>
Anyone can make a Shadowclan orc and join.
</p>

<h3>Roleplay</h3>
<p>
We are always in-character while in-game.
</p>

<h3>Fiercely Independent</h3>
<p>
We are hostile to Alliance, distrustful of non-orcs, and wary of anyone not in Shadowclan. We are also very territorial.
</p>

<h3>Respect</h3>
<p>
We respect other players as fellow players.
</p>

<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>
We train our members in the Shadowclan ways and our expectations are enforced.
</p>

<h3>Commitment</h3>
<p>
In order to stay in Shadowclan after an initial trial period, members must permanently commit their character to Shadowclan.
</p>

<h3>Community</h3>
<p>
Shadowclan members work together and share supplies freely among themselves.
</p>

<h3>Game Friendly</h3>
<p>
Our storyline and background blend in with game's storyline and background to the highest degree possible. We won't force other players to break character in order to match our own roleplay style. We follow the rules of the game. No cheating, bug exploiting, illegal 3rd party programs, or other violations of the game's Terms of Service are ever allowed.
</p>

<h2>Want to make an alternate character?</h2>
<p>
Shadowclan is designed to not only be fun for someone's primary character, but also a great guild for alternate characters, offering an alternative style of playing the game that you rarely find in other guilds.
