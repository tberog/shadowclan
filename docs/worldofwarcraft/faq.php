<h1>Frequently Asked Questions by Non-Members</h1>

<p>
<b>Q: One of your members was acting inappropriately.  Do you care?</b><br />
A: Yes we care.  Please get in touch with a
<a href="http://www.shadowclan.org/darkmoot/groupcp.php?g=4131">clan leader</a>
and send in a report with enough detail so that the problem can be dealt with properly.
</p>

<p>
<b>Q: I'm the leader of a horde guild on your server.  Can our guilds be friends?</b><br />
A: Shadowclan is inherently suspicious of anyone not in Shadowclan.  A small degree of sustained tolerance could only develop after months of positive interaction and bribes.
</p>

<p>
<b>Q: I'm not in a guild.  Shadowclan seems like fun, can I hang out with you?</b><br />
A: Shadowclan is fun.  The best way to experience Shadowclan is as part of Shadowclan, so make an orc and join. In addition, keeping Shadowclan fun takes a lot of effort, so we prefer that people become part of Shadowclan and help keep it going instead of just tagging along.
</p>

<p>
<b>Q: I like Shadowclan, but don't want to be an orc.</b><br />
A: Orcs are very versatile.  Give them a try.
