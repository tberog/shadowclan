Coming through the portal from Outland, all new members start as Peons. So don't forget your shovel, unless you want to be stuck picking flowers!
</p>
<h2>Remember to: </h2>

<p>
Contact Shadowclan in-game <b>as soon as possible</b> after character creation to join the clan.  If there is a problem with your name, you will have to create a new character with an appropriate name.  Also, you are supposed to join while you are still a low level character.  If you are above level 10, you will have to explain why you were unable to join before then.

<li>Select a <a href="classes.php">character class</a></li>

<li>Make an Orc with an <a href="names.php">appropriate name</a> on the Ravenholdt server</li>

<li> Log in and immediately type <emphasis>/who shadowclan</emphasis> to get a list of who is online.  Send a message to one of them and inform them that you want to join the clan and need to be put in touch with an Orc who can check your name and skin color. </li>

<li> Contact the Orc who can invite you. The Orc will also ask a few questions to make sure you know what is expected of you and that you know some basic orcish words.</li>

That's it!  Told you it was easy.
