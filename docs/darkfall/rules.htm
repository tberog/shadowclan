<h2>General</h2>

<p>Shadowclan members are expected to stay in character at all times. OOC communication is allowed only in private /tell channels, though IC communication is preferred there as well.</p>

<p>Shadowclan members never group with enemy races. Grouping outside the clan in general is discouraged, but allowed with friendly Orks and Mahirim.</p>

<p>Shadowclan members are discouraged from gaining negative alignment. If your alignment becomes negative, it is your responsibility to become positive again. No Shadowclan member is required to take an alignment hit in aid of another who does, doing so is at the discretion of each member. Consider this when choosing to attack an ork or Mahirim who is harassing you, but has positive alignment, as those with you will feel compelled to help you despite not being required to.</p>

<p>All items and resources are the property of the Shadowclan as a whole. Do not horde more than you require in your personal vault, and donate your excess frequently to the clan vault.</p>

<p>Do not ruin the fun of others. No OOC griefing of other players is allowed, such as blocking the view of a player's rock so that they cannot mine it.</p>

<p>All terms and conditions of Darkfall must be obeyed. 3rd party programs and exploits, disruptive skill gain within the protection of guard towers, and unattended macroing are forbidden, and will be enforced.</p>

<p>Shadowclan is a family friendly community. No excessively crude or explicit behavior will be tolerated.</p>


<h2>Clan Vault</h2>

<p>The clan vault will be stocked with minimal amounts of various items. Excess will be stored in personal vaults by official Clan Makers. Feel free to make use of supplies in the vault, but use them responsibly. All members are encouraged to deposit as much loot, raw materials, and gold into the clan vault as they can.</p>

<p>Clan makers will remove items directly related to their craft. They will be responsible for maintaining specific amounts of their craft related items in the clan vault. For example, the Clan Armor Maker may leave 5 of each armor piece available in the armor bags, and keep all excess in their personal vault. If the supply in the clan vault drops below those levels, they will refill it from their personal vault as much as they are able.</p>

<p>When depositing an item into the clan vault, take the time to become familiar with where each item type is kept, and place it in the appropriate bag. </p>


<h2>Uniforms</h2>

<p>There are three basic sets of uniforms used by Shadowclan, to make identification on the battlefield between friend and foe more visual. Each uniform is designed to serve certain purposes.</p>

<p><b>Heavy Set</b> - The heavy armor set is restricted to rank Major and above. It will be the least stocked armor set in the vault, and mostly handed out for specific events. It is expensive, and not to be used casually.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Head - Plate</li>
	<li>Chest - Plate</li>
	<li>Shoulders - Scale</li>
	<li>Legs - Scale</li>
	<li>Sleeves - Scale</li>
	<li>Belt - Scale</li>
	<li>Boots - Leather</li>
	<li>Gloves - Leather</li>
	<li>Elbows - Scale</li>
	<li>Knees - Scale</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Standard Set</b> - This is the set Shadowclan members should be wearing the majority of the time when grouped together. It is identifiable, offers solid protection, and is light enough for heavy casting. While it may be worn when solo or in a duo, it is not entirely cheap, and should be used responsibly in these situations. Pieces of this set are the only pieces our Clan Makers will be actively producing on a regular basis.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Head - Scale</li>
	<li>Chest - Studded Leather</li>
	<li>Shoulders - Bone</li>
	<li>Legs - Studded Leather</li>
	<li>Sleeves - Studded Leather</li>
	<li>Belt - Studded Leather</li>
	<li>Boots - Leather</li>
	<li>Gloves - Leather</li>
	<li>Elbows - Scale</li>
	<li>Knees - Scale</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Scrap Set</b> - The purpose of this "set" is to utilize the random pieces of equipment we find as loot. No particular item will be actively produced to fill this set, though Clan Makers may produce items used in it from time to time at their own discretion. There is a wide range in the level of quality available in this set, and it is encouraged for members to responsibly put their set together based on the activity they are undergoing.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Head - Anything not in the Heavy or Standard Set (Hood preferred)</li>
	<li>Chest - Anything not in the Heavy or Standard Set</li>
	<li>Shoulders - Anything not in the Heavy or Standard Set except Bone (Bone preferred)</li>
	<li>Legs - Anything not in the Heavy or Standard Set</li>
	<li>Sleeves - Anything not in the Heavy or Standard Set</li>
	<li>Belt - Anything not in the Heavy or Standard Set</li>
	<li>Boots - Anything not in the Heavy or Standard Set</li>
	<li>Gloves - Anything not in the Heavy or Standard Set</li>
	<li>Elbows - Anything not in the Heavy or Standard Set</li>
	<li>Knees - Anything not in the Heavy or Standard Set</li>
</ul>

<p>In the Clan Vault, there is a bag for the Heavy and Standard Uniform Sets. In these bags are several plain bags, and one colored bag. Each of the plain bags contains one full set of that uniform type. When you need a new uniform, simply empty one of these bags. Do not take individual pieces from these uniform bags. Once you have emptied a uniform bag, place the empty bag inside the colored bag. Clan Makers will check the colored bag and refill the empty bags inside it when able, and return them to the main section.</p>

<p>If you return a uniform after use, take one of the empty bags inside the colored bag, place the uniform in it, and return it to the main section. It is not required that you return your uniform after each use, it is acceptable to keep one uniform set in your personal vault. It is preferred that you keep a set that you have used heavily in your personal vault, and not return a set with low durability remaining to the uniform bag.</p>

<h2>Crafting</h2>

<p>All Shadowclan members are required to learn at least one harvesting skill, not counting skinning. Members are encouraged to harvest as often as possible.</p>

<p>Shadowclan members are allowed to learn any craft they choose if desired, except Animal Taming and Enchanting, which require permission from the Supreme general or Colonels. However, there will only be one official Clan Maker for each crafting category, and it will be up to that Clan Maker to distribute as much of the Clan resources to you as they feel appropriate. Standard makers are not allowed to actively skill up their craft making items the clan has no use for if a more useful item is available. For example, Weapon Crafters should gain skill by making two handed weapons which we always have a need for, versus one handed weapons that we have in great surplus, even though one handed weapons are more cost efficient for skill gain.</p>

<p>Crafters should not remove resources from the Clan Vault. Clan Collectors will remove these resources and distribute them to the various Clan Makers, to ensure appropriate proportions of each resource go to the proper crafts.</p>
