<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Shadowclan Orks are a division of Big Head Uzrok Deathfist's trusted Iron Orks. We believe firmly in Orkish superiority and dominance, and agressively pursue establishing it. Unlike the short-sighted Dragonbound however, we believe as Uzrok that utter destruction of the world is not in our best interest. Extorting resources out of the lesser races brings us as much pleasure as burning their homes to the ground, and we've been known to allow our prey to leave with their lives after paying tribute to our dominance. Blackmailing other nations with the threat of siege, or even capturing an enemy settlement only to sell it back to them at extortionist rates are among the many tactics employed by the Shadowclan in the name of Uzrok.</p>

<p>While we operate as a self-maintained unit for the most part, Uzrok will from time to time send word of a special assignment he can trust only the Shadowclan to carry out, and we do so with unshakable fervor. Between assignments, our own Generals organize hunting parties and raids all over Agon, while our crafters industriously ready the tools of war. Though our task of pillaging the world may require relocation from city to city on occasion, sometimes even basing our campaign out of a city owned by like-minded Orks, there is always the thought that we may one day find a place to establish a new Ork Capital, far from the influence of the Dragonbound in Flaming Skull, where Uzrok may rally further support and one day return to remove the meddlesome Dragonbound and their scheming Red Dragon Arxanthos from Morak once and for all.</p>
