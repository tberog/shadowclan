<h2>How to Join</h2>

<p>Ready to join the fight, and be all the Ork you can be? Joining Shadowclan will provide you a unique experience in Darkfall, immersive in Orkish culture, and supported by a large and very supportive community. Joining the ranks is easy. Just follow these basic steps, and you're on your way!</p>

<ol>
	<li>Read about our language and what we expect of members as detailed in the Members Guide.</li>
	<li>Create an Ork character with an appropriate Ork name. First names should not include any real world language meaning or reference. Last names can be combinations of Ork themed words such as Blakblud or Meatfist, or Old Orkish words from our advanced language such as Ghaashai or Shagund. Orkish sounding last names without meaning are also acceptable, such as Undarrg or Throg. Example names listed here are names of current members and should not be re-used.</li>
	<li>Log in and immediately open your Clans window. Search for Shadowclan, and apply for membership. If you see a Shadowclan player online, you can send them a /tell to let them know you've applied, otherwise an officer will contact you once they've seen your application. They'll ask you some very basic questions to ensure you're familiar with the Shadowclan way, and are making an attempt to use the language, then will accept your application. <b>NOTE:</b> It is important that you do this as quickly as possible, particularly so that if there is a conflict with your name and it is required that you re-create your character, less time is lost.</li>
	<li>Once you've been accepted, a Clan Chat window should open, and you're in! At this point you should send a Private Message to "Blarg" on the Shadowclan Message Boards at http://www.shadowclan.org/darkmoot/index.php, requesting access to the Darkfall Members forum.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Existing Characters</h2>

<p>While it is preferred that your character is created specifically to join Shadowclan, we do allow pre-existing characters to join on a case by case basis. You must qualify for all our fresh character standards. Characters with invalid Shadowclan ork names will not be able to join. You must also have a recommendation from at least one Shadowclan member of rank Major or above.</p>
