<a name="Ranks"><h2>In-game Ranks</h2></a>

<p><b>Supreme General</b> - Uzrok Deathfist hand picks trusted Orks to lead the various divisions of the Iron orks. The Supreme General of these divisions, such as Shadowclan, is his link to them, and within the clan serves as his direct representation. If a Supreme General should grow old and retire to a less demanding status, Uzrok will choose a new Supreme General to replace him.</p>

<p><b>General</b> - The General of the Shadowclan is the currently reigning leader of all things related to war. He leads the clan on raids of nearby settlements, and has full authority in any combat situations. To ensure the strength and energy of the General, this position is given to the winner of a ritualistic tournament held each month, where candidates battle it out and the winner reigns as General for the next month. Candidates for the tournament are chosen by the Supreme General, and Colonels.</p>

<p><b>Colonel</b> - Most of the day to day activities are lead and overseen by the Colonels. Colonels are hand picked by the Supreme General, and are respected leaders in various aspects of clan life, from hunting to crafting. Colonels also have the option of forming a tribe within Shadowclan, and choosing a member of their tribe as a candidate in the monthly contest for General.</p>

<p><b>Major</b> - Dedicated members of the clan, Majors are the proven rank and file. They have sworn allegiance to the Shadowclan, and make up the bulk of the army. Colonels or the Supreme General will offer tests to young Captains who are ready to make the full commitment to the Shadowclan, and if successful, promote them to the rank of Major.</p>

<p><b>Captain</b> - Captains are new members. They have just signed on with the Shadowclan, and have not yet proven full loyalty. Any Captain who feels Shadowclan is not the place for them may return their belongings to the Clan Vault, and leave without repercussions. If they feel they are ready to make the full commitment, they may take the test for Major, and become a full member of the clan.</p>

<p>For the sake of Clan Vault access, we do not use any in-game rank below Captain at this time.</p>


<h2>Out of Game ranks</h2>

<p><b>Uzrok Deathfist</b> - The Big Head of the Ork nation, Uzrok is not present within the actual clan, and never directly seen or heard. His will takes the form of Shadowclan Clan Helm when necessary, and the interpretation of the Supreme General.</p>

<p><b>Clan Maker</b> - This position is held by members of Major rank or above who have proved reliable and capable crafters. Members of this rank are hand picked by the Supreme General. They are responsible for keeping excess supplies related to their craft in their personal vaults, and keeping the supply in the Clan Vault at appropriate levels.</p>

<p><b>Clan Collector</b> - This position is held be members of Major rank or above. Collectors are responsible for removing all harvested resources from the clan vault, and holding them in their personal vault. They then divide what they've collected into different bags, one of each crafting category. When seeing a Clan Maker online, Collectors will hand over the contents of their associated bag of resources to that Clan Maker. Proportions of resources alotted to each craft are set by the Clan Makers and Colonel Rank and above, and can change depending on clan needs.</p>


<h2>The General Bash</h2>

<p>Once a month, the Shadowclan assembles for an event of blood and booze. Many contests are held during this event, from duels to team fights, races and free for alls. The main event however is the General Bash.</p>

<p>Each tribe is allowed to nominate one of its members as a candidate for the rank of General. The Supreme General and Colonels may also nominate certain Orks of their choosing as well. The fight is a team event, with each candidate choosing one to three team members depending on the rules of that month, from the Orks present at the event. Combatants fight naked, but are allowed a rank 0 two handed weapon, one handed weapon, bow, staff, a basic shield, twenty arrows, and twenty each of any reagents they desire. Once the fight has begun, it is a free for all among all teams present, and the team with the last Ork standing sees their candidate promoted to the rank of General for the following month.</p>
