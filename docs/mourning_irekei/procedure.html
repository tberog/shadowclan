  <h3>Joining Procedures</h3>
  <h2>Getting started as a Shadowclan Irekei</h2>
  <p>Shadowclan is an open membership guild: Anyone who wishes to create and roleplay
    an Irekei character according to our guidelines is welcome to become part
    of our Virakt. However, we also require that Shadowclan characters be born
    into the clan: Your Shadowclan Irekei will be created specifically to join
    the guild; we do not accept pre-existing characters. With the speed and ease
    with which a character can gain levels in a good guild in Shadowbane, this
    is not so much of a hardship as it might seem to veterans of Camelot or Everquest.
  </p>
  <p>When creating a character, keep the following rules in mind: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>You must, obviously, select Irekei as your race. </li>
    <li>You must select the <strong>Dark Red</strong> skin color; neither bright 
      red skin nor black skin is allowed. (Hair and beard colors and styles are 
      unrestricted.)</li>
    <li>You must have an Irekei style name.</li>
    <li>You must select the Mourning server as your world of origin. </li>
	</ul>
  <p>If you need help or information about choosing stats, traits, or a starting
    class, please see the <a href="guide.html">New Player Guide</a>.</p>
  <h2>Finding Shadowclan when you first begin to play</h2>
  <p>When you first log your new Irekei on, you will need to select a starting
    city; choose the Anomani Market. We will have a recruiter stationed in that
    village during peak hours. When you arrive, type /city Jha Shadowclan! and
    send a tell to whomever answers, saying that you'd like to join. Once you've
    made contact with the guild, the senior members will help get you equipped,
    answer any guild-related or gameplay questions you have, steer you towards
    one of our hunting parties, and if you're new to Shadowbane, help you get
    oriented to the gameworld and your controls. </p>
  <p>While you are on the starting island, your responsibilities are to become
    familiar with the gameworld, interface, and combat engine, as well as with
    the tone and playstyle of the guild, our language and customs, and so forth.
    At some point between level 10 and 20, you should move to the mainland and
    join the main Shadowclan guild on the sands of the Sun's Anvil, unless it
    seems that the guild's playstyle is not going to be compatible with your own
    preferences and interests.
