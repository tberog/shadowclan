    &amp; Powers</a> | <a href="guide4.html">Equipment</a> | <a href="guide5.html">Classes
    &amp; Professions</a></p>
  <h2>Classes and Professions</h2>
  <p>There are 10 professions available to the Irekei, deriving from 4 base classes.
    Some professions can only be reached via a single path; others can be promoted
    to from two different starting points. </p>
  <h2>Fighter only</h2>
  <p><strong>Warrior</strong>. The basic &quot;pure melee&quot; class, warriors
    focus on dealing melee damage and living to tell about it; with the most hitpoints
    of any Irekei, the ability to wear heavy armor, and the power to break roots
    or snares at a small stamina cost, the warrior has survivability in spades.
    A heavy-armor warrior will go for a strength-based weapon such as the sword;
    he might train in sword and shield, a two-handed sword, or, with the ambidexterity
    rune, dual-wielded swords. Or, a warrior might go the high-dex route, preferring
    light armor and training in dagger and shield or dual daggers; in any case,
    the warrior will also train Parry for additional defensive ability, and Toughness
    for more hitpoints. </p>
  <h2>Fighter or Rogue</h2>
  <p><strong>Ranger, Huntress.</strong> Both of these classes have the option
    to train as archers (high dex, preferring light armor, and looking for an
    Archer discipline rune to complete the template) or as melees with the option
    (as fighter base class) to take medium armor. In either case you'll be supplementing
    your physical attacks with some magical support (mostly buffs and heals for
    the ranger; a pet, pet buffs, and some damage spells for the huntress), meaning
    you may not want to completely ignore Spirit. Melee Huntresses will specialize
    in the Spear (they get +30% to that skill at promotion), while rangers have
    the option to specialize in any of several different weapons; a melee rogue
    ranger in light armor would do very well with buffed dagger damage, further
    magnified with Backstab from a Black Mask discipline rune. Rangers and Huntresses
    both get tracking abilities. For either profession, starting with the fighter
    class will offer superior combat ability while the rogue offers Hide and Sneak;
    either path is viable. </p>
  <h2>Rogue only</h2>
  <p><strong>Thief, Scout.</strong> The thief is the most melee-ready of any of
    the rogue classes, with GM-grade powers and stances and the unique ability
    to train both Dodge and Parry; similarly, the Scout is the only archer class
    which gets the Archery powers without having to find a discipline rune. Both
    classes offer other unique abilities; thieves can train Peek and Steal to
    remove items from another player's backpack (largely a novelty at this point),
    as well as the Bargaining skill which reduces the markup on items being purchased
    from vendors (all the way to 0 markup at a bargaining skill of 100; buying
    at cost is good!); scouts can train skills which increase their stamina and
    runspeed dramatically, as well as being the only class in the game able to
    detect and reveal grandmaster stealthers. </p>
  <h2>Rogue or Mage: </h2>
  <p><strong>Assassin, Bard.</strong> Both classes are currently on the low side
    of the power tuning cycle. Assassins are intended as 1-on-1 PVP specialists
    with unique spells such as stun resistance and the ability to silence another
    player, coupling melee dagger powers with magical offense; bards, on the other
    hand, seem to be built as a support class but have effectiveness issues in
    that their songs are in large part redundant with and/or inferior to timer-based
    buffs available from other classes. For either class, rogues will almost certainly
    train dual daggers and light armor, plus training their spell skill and associated
    powers (and, of course, Hide and Sneak), while mages will focus almost exclusively
    on their spell abilities plus bread-and-butter spells from the mage baseline
    such as Mage Bolt and Blood Boil. </p>
  <h2>Mage only</h2>
  <p><strong>Wizard, Fury</strong>. As pure spellcasters, these mages have only
    3 skills to worry about: Sorcery, Warding, and their professional skill; you
    have no armor or dodge-type skills to train, and the only reason to train
    a weapon is to be able to equip magical staves with superior bonuses. Most
    of your trains will go into specific individual spells; see spell lists and
    guides elsewhere for more information. </p>
  <h2>Mage or Healer</h2>
  <p><strong>Channeler.</strong> The mage channeler plays much like a fury or
    wizard in many ways, although obviously with a different selection of spells;
    the healer channeler, on the other hand, also has the option to train light
    armor and block for increased survivability at the expense of some trains
    that would otherwise have gone into more spells. Healer channelers also have
    access to targeted and groupwide stat buffs and heals; specializing a healer
    for support means reduced nuking ability, but your groupmates will love you.
    Healers also have the unique ability to Succor a grave, restoring some experience
    to the player who died there, as well as being able to Summon another character
    to him from anywhere in the world, once per five minutes.</p>

  <h2>Important Classes</h2>
  <p>Shadowclan isn't Rogueclan. We have a need of Warriors, Wizards and Channelers.
    The other classes are also important, but these 3 should not be neglected.
    Channelers are especially valued for their summoning ability.</p>
