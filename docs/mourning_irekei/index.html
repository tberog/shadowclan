  <h2> What makes Shadowclan so fun?</h2>

  <p>Over a thousand players have been a part of Shadowclan. Here are some reasons

    why: </p>

  <ul>

    <li><strong>Having fun</strong> &#8211; Key to being a Shadowclan member is

      having fun at what you are doing, without ruining the fun of others. We

      love to provide people with an enemy they enjoy fighting.</li>

    <li><strong>Roleplay</strong> &#8211; Shadowclan members are required to be

      in-character at all times while in-game. </li>

    <li><strong>Open Membership</strong> &#8211; Anyone is welcome to join Shadowclan

      with a new character that conforms to Shadowclan policies.</li>

    <li><strong>Community &amp; cooperation</strong> &#8211; Nothing is more important

      to Shadowclan members than the Shadowclan community itself. Everything is

      shared and expected to remain within the community. </li>

    <li><strong>Respect</strong> &#8211; Shadowclan members are expected to be

      mature members of the player community, treating fellow players with respect.</li>

    <li><strong>Quality</strong> &#8211; We train our new members in the Shadowclan

      ways, and expect them to act appropriately.</li>

    <li><strong>Combat</strong> &#8211; Player versus Player combat, as it fits

      within our roleplay, is a key part of Shadowclan. </li>

    <li><strong>Committed characters</strong> &#8211; While we have open membership,

      we expect characters in Shadowclan to join when their character is created

      and for that character to stay in Shadowclan. This promotes sharing and

      cooperation between members as they know that aiding their fellow members

      will be aiding Shadowclan. Traitors to Shadowclan are treated very poorly.

    </li>

    <li><strong>Game Friendly</strong> &#8211; Our storyline and background blend

      in with game's storyline and background to the highest degree possible.

      We won't force other players to break character in order to match our own

      roleplay style. We follow the rules of the game. No cheating, bug exploiting,

      illegal 3rd party programs, or other violations of the game's Terms of Service

      are ever allowed.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>About Shadowclan</h2>

  <p>Shadowclan began in October 1997 when a handful of players in Ultima Online

    on the Great Lakes shard decided to take the place of the stupid AI monsters

    and provide a more intelligent enemy. They were the first Shadowclan Orcs,

    and lived out of a tent. From the beginning, they roleplayed and stayed in-character

    as orcs. </p>

  <p>Since those days Shadowclan has expanded to two branches in Ultima Online 

    (Siege Perilous in addition to Catskills), a branch in EverQuest, and 2 branches 

    in DAOC (Mordred and Guinevere). The Shadowbane branc represents our sixth 

    active branch.</p>
