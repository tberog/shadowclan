<h2>Organization</h2>

<p>
Shadowclan's Vindication branch has a very simple organization. A Council of 6 to 10 members manages the in-game and out-of-game needs of the clan. This includes: tactical and strategic leadership, overseeing our lore, logistics, city management, training, promotions, appointing sub-leaders, trade and diplomacy. Many of these tasks are spread down the ranks to both Sek'alar and Irikhan.
</p>
<p>
Members are allowed and encouraged to form lore-based associations within the game.
</p>

<h2>Chain of Command</h2>

<p>
Shadowclan has strict and absolute policies regarding chain of command. Lower-rank characters are expected to obey all orders from any higher-rank characters, at all times, without backtalk. If you believe an order is incorrect, register your disagreement (politely. once.) and then do it anyway. If you believe an order violates Shadowclan policy, see above and also contact a guild officer to report the issue; take screenshots or a recording if possible. </p><p>
A senior member issuing orders to players in a different group should issue his orders to or through the group leader rather than directly to individuals within the group, unless absolutely necessary. A group leader is considered to outrank anyone else in his group of the same rank. The rank structure in the Shadowclan branch is as follows: Guild officers (Khal'usht, Arkh'alar, Khal'urvho ranks) -> Sek'alar -> Irikhan -> Urikhan and Jov'uus
</p>

<h2>Equipment &amp; Economy</h2>

<p>
Shadowclan operates with a communal economy. There is no private ownership of any items or coin; all property held by any Shadowclan character is is considered to be owned by the guild. Feel free to ask any senior member for help if you are short funds for purchasing or repairing mundane equipment or for unspiked training; you are expected not to spike any training, and not to use magical items unless you can afford to maintain them yourself.</p>
<p>
In your vault, you should keep one "good" set of backup equipment, one "junk" set of backup-backup equipment, a few recall scrolls, and enough gold to cover a couple of repair sessions and a level or two of training. Anything beyond that should be sold to our vendors (equipment) or given to a guild officer for distribution (runestones and gold). Do not save or hoard any items in your vault which you cannot use yet due to rank or stats; such items should be put into circulation for immediate use by other players. Players may not buy anything from or sell anything to any other city, or any non-Shadowclan player, without specific authorization from a guild officer. Buying one recall scroll to come home from another city is permitted if necessary, but should not be necessary if your vault is appropriately stocked. Do not train or repair in other cities unless you must.

<h2>Uniforms</h2>
<p>
Urikhan and Jov'uus are not permitted to wear any headgear. All other equipment is permitted.
</p>

<h2>Duelling</h2>

<p>
You do not challenge a fellow Shadowclan Irekei directly. Instead, you must bring your challenge to an Irekei who holds higher rank than both you and your opponent, who will act as judge. After hearing your challenge and your opponent's response, the judge may rule to allow the duel, to disallow it, or to postpone it if there are more pressing matters at hand. The decision of the judge is final and cannot be appealed; if he rules there is no cause for a duel you may not challenge again for the same grievance. If the judge rules the challenge and timing are appropriate, the challengee may not decline the duel, although he may decline to defend himself.
</p>

<p>
Urikhan (including jov'uus) may not be challenged to duels. Players of any rank may spar among themselves by mutual consent. Irikhan and above should remove headgear before doing so. Sparring is not considered a duel.
</p>

<p>
Higher rank members may execute or order the execution of lower-rank members as punishment if needed; clan quality control should be contacted if this authority is abused. Execution is not considered a duel.
</p>

<p>
The requirement for a higher-rank judge means that guild officers can neither challenge nor be challenged to duels. Challenges between unequal-rank opponents will in most cases be denied unless both parties are willing. Most duels will be between two Irikhan.
