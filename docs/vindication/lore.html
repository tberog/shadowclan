<h2>The Words of the Burned Prophet</h2>

<p>
Heed the words of Prophets, for truer words have never been spoken.
</p>

<p>
Only a few generations ago the Shadowclan Irekei were visited by a lone prophet. The Wandering Prophet came to warn of dire times. He condemned those who would be corrupted by the ways of the fir'khanim and warned that Khalikryst, the Phoenix, had left her perch and betrayed the Dragon and his people. Standing before the gathered masses the Prophet spoke, "Beware the vices of the Rain Bleeders, for they are traps set by the servants of the Meddler gods, and are meant to ensnare you and weaken your bond with Nkurakar. No longer does Khalikryst watch over the Desert, no longer does she protect the People of the Dragon, for now she is not to be trusted. The Deserter she will be named, for in a time of great strife she has forsaken her People."

<h2>The Words of the Ancient Prophets</h2>

<p>
"...and perhaps one day a great leader will emerge who can unite the warring tribes and lead them to victory over the fir'khanim that remain on this broken world., teaching them new meanings of the word fear. Perhaps that leader will march beneath the banner of the Shadowclan, raising our flags above their broken, burning cities. Perhaps the Great Dragon will then rise, culling the weak from the herd, leaving only the worthy, the strong. No my young ones, there is no perhaps about it, it has been foretold."
<br />
Traditional legend as related by the infamous Irekei Sage, Vas'khanim</p>

<p>
"I see ... the fir'khanim ... bound together... a great empire upon the Greenlands! They tire of our ways ... and our raids upon their settlements ... And they bring death and foul magics upon the Burning Sands, in an attempt to destroy our people! The struggle is long ... and hard&#8212;fought, and many Irekei become one with the Dragon ... in the end, we have victory, pushing our foes back ... But the inner fire is stirred within our Blood ... our people become grievously angered at the audacity of the fir'khanim! Our armies sally forth to bring vengeance upon those who sought to erase us from the world! The Sacrificial Fires to the Great Dragon burn across the lands and the fir'khanim bow their heads in worship ... or their bodies feed the flames. This, is what I see."<br />

<h2>Irekei Holy Writings</h2>

<p>
The Prophecies relating to Kry'Abalakar, the Great Awakening<br />
"[18]In the time when Strife has filled the lands and the rains come again into the Burning Lands, there will be an awakening. [19]Silence will become whispers, whispers will be become speech, and speech will show wisdom to those whose minds are opened. [20]The rains will be driven from the Holy Sands one by one and the Fire Rising shall spread through the Western Badlands. [21]Then shall the Children of the Dragon harken to It's call. [22]Some will grow strong of body, some strong of mind, but all will grow strong in their Khar'ika. [23]This will be called KryAbalakar, the Great Holy Awakening, and all the lesser races shall be put to sleep. [24]KryKhal'Nkurakar will burn the lands, the waters, the weak, and the bhalo'khalim and only the strong of Khar'ika shall survive."
</p><p>
KryBhal'Nkurkarin (The Holy Truth of the Great and Everlasting Terror [Dragon]), Chapter 28, Verses 18&#8212;24.
</p><p>
Footnote, 28:24: bhalo'khalim, 'false fires', most likely refers to fires of the All&#8212;Father Worshipers and those of the descendants of Malorn in the Temple of Cleansing Flame.
</p>

<p>
"[5]Your brethren will betray the old ways, and become weak as the fir'khanim are. [6]In the days before KryAbalakar, the vir'aktal will experience strife as none have ever experienced before. [7] The Great Nation will be broken and its members sent to the far Vir. [8] The corruption of the fir'khanim will find its way into the hearts of many, but I say to you deny them brothers. [9] The fir'khan corruption cannot be cured, only destroyed. [10] Prepare your Khar'ika, for the final trial awaits and its survivors shall inherit the world for their own."
</p><p>
KryArch'OxatTikmal (Holy Prophecy of the End Times) &#8212; The Testament of Vor'kha M'nukh, Prophet of Vir'akt Vish'rah. Chapter 10, Verses 5&#8212;10.
