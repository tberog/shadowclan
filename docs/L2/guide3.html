  <h2>Skills and Powers</h2>
  <p><strong>Fighters and Rogue</strong>s receive 4 skill points each level from
    2 to 10, and <strong>Mages and Healers </strong>get 5. Once you select a profession<strong>
    </strong>at level 10, you can add 6 to that number from that point on, so
    you get either 10 or 11 points per level from 11 to 59, the not-so-soft cap.
    This will give you somewhere around 550 training points by the time you cap
    your character... specifically, 584 total trains for a level 59 mage or healer,
    or 526 for level 59 fighters and rogues, a disparity which balances out when
    you consider that most magical powers must be trained up from 0 or 1 to the
    desired power level (up to a possible maximum of 40, &quot;Grand Master&quot;),
    while most melee powers are generally granted at a fixed and capped power
    level with no training investment required. </p>
  <p>Unlike powers which are either fixed, or have a set cap at 40 or lower, skills
    can be trained as high as you wish (subject to the Int+60 cap mentioned earlier).
    The first 10 trains in a skill raise it 2% each, and 1% each for the next
    80 trains; going higher than that returns only 1% skill per 2 trains. All
    skills get a bonus from 2 attributes: Intelligence, and some other stat which
    varies depending on the skill... Spirit for magic skills, Dexterity for dodge,
    and so forth. The full formula for untrained skill is 4 + 3*Int/20 + Other/10.
    You can expect a softcapped character to have raw skills approximately in
    the 20-40% range depending on how strongly you have invested in the appropriate
    attributes, with highly Intelligent characters tending towards the higher
    end of that range; it should take you in the neighborhood of 50-70 trains
    to take any skill to 100%, required to wear the best armor or weapons. Note
    that a high-level character will probably want his primary attack skill at
    around 120 or possibly higher, in order to get good to-hit against high rank
    monsters and enemy players.</p>
  <p>Recommending specific skills and powers for each class is beyond the scope
    of this guide, but here are a few comments: Your primary attack skill should
    end up somewhat higher than 100%, as mentioned above. All classes except mages
    should expect to raise an armor skill to 100. Melee classes should also be
    training one or more defensive skills (parry, dodge, block) as well as a weapon
    mastery (boosts both ATR and DEF and grants additional powers) to at least
    moderate levels. If you can GM stealth, you should; scouts should also GM
    Detect. Mages have far fewer skills to worry about, and will instead spend
    most of their training points raising individual powers (spells)... be careful
    when doing this, though, as mana costs rise as you train a power, and you
    may find some abilities more useful with moderate or even with no training
    than fully raised to 40. </p>
