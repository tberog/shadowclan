<!-- Updates should be placed only between Comment Tags marked as "Edit Text Begins" and "Edit Text Ends"

There are 4 levels of Text: H1 for main heading, H2 for sub-headings, H5 for cutlines and sub-sub-headings, and P for all ordinary text.

Links will automatically appear as defined by the style sheet.

Do not edit any of the DIV tags.

There are 4 DIV IDs:

1) TOP contains the image at the top of the page. This DIV does not need to be edited by page or section updaters. This DIV contains no text.

2) LEFT contains the menu in the left column. Standard HTML hyperlink rules apply. Each link is separated by the XMTL tag <br />

3) MIDDLE contains the copy for the page. Follow nomal HTML 4 rules or XMTL rules as defined by the W3C XHTML 1.0 Transitional DTD. Allowable tags are <P></P>, <H1></H1>, <H2></H2>, <H5></H5>. Please do not use non-breaking spaces to indent paragraph beginnings, all copy is flush left/ragged right.

If you insert a table into this column please do not used fixed-width table or cell setings, the MIDDLE column floats to match the width of the browser window. Do not fix a table width, but do fix cell widths at percentages of 100 (i.e., 3 columnn tables would have cell widths of 33,33,33).

Images set into the middle column should be no wider than 250 pixels in order to avoid odd behaviours. Do not insert images without optimizing them for web viewing and specifying the image's dimensions in the tag.

4) RIGHT DIV ID is for supplementalinformation, highlighting points of importance and for small images no wider than 110 pixels.

A note on IMAGES: by default only small size images appear on any full page. If there is a need for a larger image to appear, link the smaller image to the larger image and have the larger appear alone in its own browser window. the IMG tag should indicate target="blank" in order for this to work.

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><b>Ways of the Clan</b></p>
  <p>What we lack in strength, we make up for in cunning. What we lack in cunning,
    we make up for in knowledge. What we lack in knowledge, we make up for in
    strength. We are vicious, warlike and considered savages by many of the peoples
    of the world. <i>Skah</i>! Do they not know the joy of defeating your enemies
    and smelling the burning of their cities? They are nothing but <i>fir'khanim</i>,
    weak and soulless. Cold to the touch as if they were already dead. We roam
    free over the sands, and the blood runs hot in our veins. We are the Shadowclan,
    emboldened by the first of the Great Signs and bound to the Sands, the Sun
    and the Dragon. Our inner fires will sustain us and help us to cleanse the
    world of all who are unworthy.</p>
  <p>
    <p>We call the deserts our home, for to live in the Greenlands is to make
      oneself soft and weak, as the fir'khanim. Young Irekei are tested from birth.
      Those who are not strong and quick enough to be worthy of The Dragon are
      left to the mercies of the wastelands. Pillaging and scavenging are part
      of every Irekei's life. The desert is a harsh teacher where few can survive
      without proper equipment. We have learned to make do with what we can gather
      from the land and from those who are weaker. To be called 'soft' is a great
      insult in Irekei culture, for it implies that the Irekei in question has
      taken on undesirable traits from the <i>fir'khanim</i>.</p>
    <p>To betray your Clan is to betray yourself. To be cast from the Clan is
      the worst punishment imaginable to any Irekei. Such outcasts are known as
      <i>vrek</i>, and their<i> khar'ika</i> is dimmed; marked for any Irekei
      to see. They are shunned by all <i>virakt</i> and inevitably end up committing
      themselves to the Dragon deep within the Burning Sands. No markers are erected
      for them, and the scouring <i>Skath</i>, the fearsome desert wind, quickly
      reduces their bones to dust.</p>
    <p>The desert <b>is</b> the Irekei. Its resources are ours. Its sands are
      ours. These are the testing grounds of our children, that they might live
      or die by the desert’s tests of strength and will. The desert is not for
      the <i>fir’khanim</i>, except to moisten with their blood. These lands are
      holy to us. We will allow no <i>fir’khanim</i> to gain a foothold in the
      desert, or even to walk upon the sands without our permission.</p>
  <p>It is rumored that the Shadowclan keeps a 'Forbidden City' deep within the
    desert where <i>fir'khanim</i> are never allowed, it's true name never uttered
    where outsiders might overhear. Supposedly, some of the greatest works of
    Irekei artisans can be found there in the form of great murals and shrines
    to the Dragon. Similarly, it is only there that many secret Irekei arts and
    skills are taught. </p>
  <p>
    <p>
      <p>
          <p><b>Khan'jallakar:</b><br>
            <p>Any war upon another <i>Virakt</i> shall be openly declared before
            any serious hostilities commence. Such is the way of our people. The
            <i>fir'khanim </i>, however, are not worthy of such respect.</p>
            <p>Though not all follow it's path, within every Irekei beats a Warrior's
              heart. Deception, deceit and trickery are tools to be used against
              the <i>fir'khanim</i>. When you are fighting your brethren, stand
              tall and proud.</p>

  <p>
      <p>
                <p>
                  <b>Returning to the Sands:</b>
                  <p>Given the nature of Irekei life, most of our people do not
                    live to what would be considered old age. Those that do are
                    often respected and venerated as they have proved themselves
                    worthy through many generations. But, no Irekei wishes to
                    die in their bed, and there comes a time when an ancient Irekei
                    might consider themselves of no more use to the Clan. At such
                    a point, they divest themselves of all belongings save a small
                    knife and the clothes upon their back (and sometimes not even
                    that). Relieved of the burden of wealth and responsibility,
                    they walk out alone into the Deep Desert, never to be seen
                    again. Such Irekei are much honored in tales and song and
                    they are said to have 'Returned to the Sands'.</p>
              <p>This custom continues to this day, despite the effects of the
                Great Stirring of the Dragon. Many Irekei philosophers and prophets
                say that those who never return to the Tree of the Dragon have
                their spirits plucked from the ether by the Terror of Terrors.
                Those that are worthy are consumed to forever be a part of <i>Kryquo'Khalin</i>
                while the others are cast into the Great Void.</p>

  <p>Joining the Virakt is a lifelong commitment. Those who leave and join other
    guilds are branded <i>vrek</i> and hunted unmercilessly. Other guilds that
    accept these traitors will find it very difficult to deal with the Irekei
    and may even find themselves subject to brutal raids.</p>
