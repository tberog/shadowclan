  <h2>Equipment</h2>
  <p>Although WP's stated goal way back when was to make a game where equipment
    was far less important than character abilities and player skill, the truth
    is that your gear can and will make a large difference in your effectiveness
    as a player and will affect the way in which you develop your character's
    abilities. +stat gear can be used to shore up weak areas or further boost
    your strengths; mana regeneration is critical for any casting class; magical
    resistances can mean the difference between victory or death against opposing
    spellcasters, and Windlord boots provide a speed boost prized by anyone with
    the possible exception of Scouts. Select your gear with an eye to building
    a well-rounded character; use equipment to fill in holes in your character
    template or to further boost the area where you're strongest.</p>
