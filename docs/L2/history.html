  <h3>History</h3>



  <h2>Tales, Myths and Legends</h2>

  <p>We found the Sand, the burning deserts and called them home. We endured and

    became worthy of transcendence. We were passed through the Transforming Flame,

    and our spirits were bolstered with its heat, elevating our ancestors into

    the superior beings we are today. Though emboldened, we were still to be tested.

    By the Desert, the Sun, the Sand and the dreadful Skath. The weak were culled

    from our people and we become strong and fierce. Though the Sand still tests

    us to this day, we no longer fear it. It is the Anvil of the Sun, and upon

    it we are forged and shaped. It is as much a part of us as the Fire that burns

    within.<br />

    <br />

    In the Before Time, we were lost and soulless. Cold to the touch and without

    will. It was the Time of Darkness. The Unfinished Ones, the ancestors of our

    people, were soft and deluded. Trapped by ignorance in the cold, bleak world.

    But the Terror arose, and Darivastor, the first to see, discovered new wisdom.

    For here was a force mightier than all else arrayed against it. </p>

  <p>With the kindling of the Sun began the Time of Embers. We stayed upon the

    Burning Sands beneath eternal light and blessed heat, and we endured. We worshipped

    the Great Dragon, and from its restless slumbering dreams our first Blood

    Prophets were born, heralding visions of a time when the Dragon would awake

    and only the worthy would be spared. And through them the Phoenix Goddess

    was stirred to action. She taught us much and we came to call the deserts

    home. </p>

  <p>Then came The Change, when the first day was ended and the flow of time begun.

    The Meddling God attempted to hide the Lady of the Sun from us, but our heroes

    fought against his designs, causing the cycle of days and nights that shall

    continue until the end. </p>

  <p>At long last, our time of seeking for our true selves was brought to an end

    by Jall&#8217;kroda, the Blood Lord. Khalikryst was freed from her bonds and

    descended upon our people with the Transforming Flame. Thus was our khar'ika

    ignited, never to be quenched and thus were our people born. </p>

  <p>This began the Time of Flames. Yet another testing for the Irekei. The Hateful

    Ones attacked us with much fury, fearful of the power we had and afraid of

    our attempts to rouse the Dragon. Though they could not hope to match the

    skill and fierceness of the Irekei, the Hateful Ones were numerous, and our

    people began to be driven back. </p>

  <p>But, it was the Dragon who saved us again, whispering secrets into the head

    of P&#8217;reklabhar and telling her of the ways of the Chaos Gate. Through

    great magical ceremonies, she opened the gate, unleashing the Hordes upon

    our enemies. The Horde passed us by in gratitude for the favors we had done,

    and our people retired to the deeps of the deserts to replenish our strength.

    It was apparent that the time for the Awakening had not yet arrived. </p>

  <p>Once, long ago, our people were as one. But as we became accustomed to our

    new selves and grew in numbers and power, our people began warring amongst

    themselves. The weak-willed fir'khanim would have fallen before us as quickly

    as the shifting sand had we the unity of old. We fought ourselves as much

    as the outsiders. </p>

  <p>But then, The Dragon stirred, breaking this world into scattered pieces.

    Our time of destiny is nigh. We must prove ourselves strong in order to burn

    for eternity within the Dragon itself. It is time for the wars against the

    fir'khanim to intensify, and for blood to spill upon the ground. </p>

  <p>The banner of the Shadowclan shall lead the way. The other virakt will join

    in or face extermination. Now is not the time to coddle the weak-willed or

    hesitate in our actions. The Dragon demands strength and fortitude. Any who

    cannot meet these requirements will find their khar'ika extinguished forever

    and forgotten.</p>

  <h2>Rise of the Shadowclan</h2>

  <p>After the Stirring of the Dragon, many among our people realized that a sign
    had come to us. A group of Irekei Elders gathered together three proud and
    powerful <i>Arkhakts</i>. These <i>Arkhakts</i> pledged their loyalty and
    a new virakt was formed by the name of Shadowclan. </p>

  <h2>Noted Irekei of History</h2>

  <h2> Tales, Legends and Prophecies:</h2>

  <p>&quot;...and perhaps one day a great leader will emerge who can unite the

    warring tribes and lead them to victory over the fir'khanim that remain on

    this broken world., teaching them new meanings of the word fear. Perhaps that

    leader will march beneath the banner of the Shadowclan, raising our flags

    above their broken, burning cities. Perhaps the Great Dragon will then rise,

    culling the weak from the herd, leaving only the worthy, the strong. No my

    young ones, there is no perhaps about it, it has been foretold.&quot;</p>

  <p> <em>Traditional legend as related by the infamous Irekei Sage, Vas'khanim</em></p>

  <p>&quot;I see ... the fir'khanim ... bound togethe r... a great empire upon

    the Greenlands! They tire of our ways ... and our raids upon their settlements

    ... And they bring death and foul magics upon the Burning Sands, in an attempt

    to destroy our people! The struggle is long ... and hard-fought, and many

    Irekei become one with the Dragon ... in the end, we have victory, pushing

    our foes back ... But the inner fire is stirred within our Blood ... our people

    become grievously angered at the audacity of the fir'khanim! Our armies sally

    forth to bring vengeance upon those who sought to erase us from the world!

    The Sacrificial Fires to the Great Dragon burn across the lands and the fir'khanim

    bow their heads in worship ... or their bodies feed the flames. This, is what

    I see.&quot;<br />
