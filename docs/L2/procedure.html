  <h3>Joining Procedures</h3>
  <h2>Getting started as a Shadowclan Member</h2>
  <p>Shadowclan is an open membership guild: Anyone who wishes to create and roleplay
    a character according to our guidelines is welcome to become part
    of our Clan. However, we also require that Shadowclan characters be born
    into the clan: Your Shadowclan will be created specifically to join
    the guild; we do not accept pre-existing characters.  Now if you level a little bit before
    you can find one of our leaders, thats OK, but if you are level 30, and want to join, you are
    out of luck.  As a rule of thumb, you should contact us before reaching level 10, with level 15
    being the latest.
  </p>
  <p>When creating a character, keep the following rules in mind: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>You must select either the Dark elf or the Orc as your race </li>
    <li>You must have an orc or dark elf style name.</li>
    <li>You must select the Kain server as your world of origin. </li>
	</ul>

  <h2>Finding Shadowclan when you first begin to play</h2>
  <p>When you first log your new orc or dark elf, you will start in your respective home town.
    Type "name to start contacting the leaders.  If no leaders are on, contact any member of shadowclan you can find
	and they can point you in the right direction.
	<p>
	<b>Please note that although any of the four Orc class are allowed, only the following Dark Elf classes are allowed:</b>
	<BR><br>
	Dark Mage -> Dark Oracle -> Shilien Oracle<br>
	Dark Fighter -> Dark Assasin -> Phantom Ranger
	<BR><br>
	You will *NOT* be able to join shadowclan if you are not one of the above classes.
