<h3>General Rules and Guidelines</h3>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>CHAIN OF COMMAND</h2>

<p>Shadowclan has strict and absolute policies regarding chain of
command. Lower-rank characters are expected to expected to obey all
orders from any higher-rank characters, at all times, without
backtalk. If you believe an order is incorrect, register your
disagreement (politely. once.) and then do it anyway. If you
believe an order violates Shadowclan policy, see above and also
contact a guild officer to report the issue; take screenshots or a
recording if possible. A senior member issuing orders to players in
a different group should issue his orders to or through the group
leader rather than directly to individuals within the group, unless
absolutely necessary. A group leader is considered to outrank
anyone else in his group of the same rank. In the event of
conflicting orders, obey the higher ranking member; in the event of
conflicting orders from two members of equal ranks, obey an
individual in your group or your arkhakt before one who is not.
Sek'alar from one arkh'akt do have the authority to command Irikhan
of the other arkh'aktal but should use this authority only
sparingly. The rank structure in the Shadowclan branch is as
follows: Guild officers (Khal'usht, Arkh'alar, Khal'urvho ranks)
-&gt; Sek'alar -&gt; Irikhan -&gt; Urikhan and Jov'uus</p>

<p></p>

<h2>EQUIPMENT AND ECONOMY</h2>

<p>Shadowclan operates with a communal economy. There is no private
ownership of any items or coin; all property held by any Shadowclan
character is is considered to be owned by the guild. Feel free to
ask any senior member for help if you are short funds for
purchasing or repairing mundane equipment or for unspiked training;
you are expected not to spike any training, and not to use magical
items unless you can afford to maintain them yourself. In your
vault, you should keep one "good" set of backup equipment, one
"junk" set of backup-backup equipment, a few recall scrolls, and
enough gold to cover a couple of repair sessions and a level or two
of training. Anything beyond that should be sold to our vendors
(equipment) or given to a guild officer for distribution
(runestones and gold). Do not save or hoard any items in your vault
which you cannot use yet due to rank or stats; such items should be
put into circulation for immediate use by other players. Players
may not buy anything from or sell anything to any other city, or
any non-Shadowclan player, without specific authorization from a
guild officer. Buying one recall scroll to come home from another
city is permitted if necessary, but should not be necessary if your
vault is appropriately stocked. Do not train or repair in other
cities unless you must.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>UNIFORMS</h2>

<p>Urikhan and Jov'uus are not permitted to wear any headgear and
are not permitted to wear Irekei Leather. All other equipment is
permitted; however, we discourage the use of any blatantly
non-Irekei-looking gear such as Hunting Leather, Troubadour cloth,
and the various "white" (shiny) styles of heavy armor; such armors
should be used only in emergencies and replaced as soon as
possible. As the arkhakt'al further develop their own identities
and as other organizations (tribes and orders) form within the
guild, some specific equipment pieces may be reserved as
identifying uniforms. No such restricted pieces have been defined
at this time.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>GROUPS, GOLD, AND LOOTING</h2>

<p>Each group should designate a master looter (kolekt'ular). This
person will pick up all runes and magic items, and all gold once
everyone present has enough to cover training and repair needs and
split is turned off. Magic items will be identified and announced
to the group, and distributed as needed, subject to the discretion
of the group leader. The looter will NOT pick up mundane items;
other players in the group should pick up non-magical weapons and
armor once the looter has done his thing.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>ATTRIBUTE RUNESTONES</h2>

<p>Do not apply any runes to stats that you are not already capped
in. If you're not yet capped, you don't need it yet, and somebody
else might. If nobody else needs it first, you can get it back when
you're ready for it. Do not apply any runes you're not planning to
fill up. Plan out your total stats before applying any runes; if
you only need to take a stat to cap+20, don't waste a +35 rune that
someone else could use. This applies even if you can't find the +20
stone you need. Do not upgrade a +30 or +35 rune. These are rare
top-end runes; if you've already used one it's unfair to overwrite
it with a +40. If you have your heart set on a +40, let the 30s go
to players who can finish their characters with them. Str, Con,
Spi: Irekei have low natural caps in these areas; runes of all
sizes will be needed. If your natural cap is 90, don't apply a +5
rune; save those for the 85'ers. Don't plan on applying more than 2
or 3 runes to any one of these stats for the time being... getting
a +40 onto a starting 85 cap takes 8 runes in sequence, something
we can't really afford until we have a much more substantial rune
collection. Dex, Int: The smaller runes for these stats aren't as
crucial since the caps are naturally higher; the larger runes are
very highly in demand. Use smaller runes as needed, but don't apply
a big one and then overwrite it. As with any items, distribution of
newly-found runes is at the discretion of the group leader. If
nobody in the group needs it and qualifies as per the usage
guidelines above, offer it on guild chat or deliver to an officer.
If more than one person in the group wants and qualifies for the
rune, it goes to the highest rank; ties in rank resolved as the
group leader sees fit. It is not necessary to deliver attribute
runestones to officers if there is a player online who can use it
under the usage guidelines.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>DISCIPLINE RUNESTONES</h2>

<p>Urikhan mages may contact a guild officer to request a Blood
Prophet initiation. Urikhan unarmed-combat specialists may contact
a guild officer to request a Sun Dancer initation. In all other
cases, disciplines are reserved for Irikhan and above. All
discipline applications are a matter of ceremony and should be
roleplayed and witnessed by a guild officer.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>MAINLAND HUNTING</h2>

<p>Characters of rank 4 or lower may not participate in mainland
experience hunts unless specifically instructed to do so by a guild
officer or the senior character online. This is likely to happen
only in two situations: Early-morning hunting when there's only one
group of Irekei awake, or if the mainland group needs a particular
class to remain viable and no rank-5's are available. Rank 5
characters are permitted to participate in mainland hunting at
will, but may not do so to the exclusion of all other activities.
Rank 5 characters are expected to devote a substantial portion of
their playing time to support activities such as desert patrols or
helping lower-level sekr'aktal- of the time remaining after raids
and events and daily maintenance, no more than half should be spent
on the mainland. Players on mainland hunts are required to have
recall scrolls at all times and must be prepared to recall
immediately if so ordered. All gold from mainland hunting should be
collected for donation to Nkuru. Maintenance funds should be
acquired in the desert.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>COMMUNICATION</h2>

<p>All communication in /say, /shout, or /guild should be
in-character. Newer members have some leeway on the language but
are expected to make an effort to use at least basic Irekei
vocabulary. /info can be used for game-mechanics questions but
should be used sparingly; players may wish to turn /info off or
change the color from yellow to something else if they do not with
to be confronted with ooc game questions. /city is reserved for use
by guild officers or raid leaders, or for issuing critical guild
alerts- "50 CoS headed NW ik Khar" should be on /city whether
you're an officer or not. Tells to other Shadowclan may be out of
character if necessary for effective communication. All in-game
communication with non-Shadowclan players must be in-character
regardless of mode. You may use broken English if necessary to
communicate your meaning. Harassing or demeaning tells to other
players are never appropriate. Do not send mocking tells to other
players after killing them. Do not respond to such tells if you
receive them. Under no circumstances should you harass another
guildmember for any reason. Any disagreements you cannot settle in
an amicable manner should be escalated to a guild officer.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>NPC IREKEI</h2>

<p>Lirek, Bhalalar Khar'uus, is unfit for the responsibility he has
been entrusted with, and should be relieved of duty whenever seen
at his post. Other named Irekei may be challenged, one on one and
in passing, but should not be farmed repeatedly. NPC Irekei rank
and file should not be attacked for any reason without specific
instructions from a guild officer.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>TRIBUTE, TERRITORY, AND FIR'KHAN RELATIONS</h2>

<p><b>-Tyrranth Minor</b><br>
 On the newby islands, the paramount rule is not to ruin the fun of
others while staying in character. This means not pushing the
arrogant Irekei bit so far that other players are insulted or
offended: try to roleplay with them if you wish, but leave them
alone if they're not getting it or not enjoying it. Don't forget
that every single player in this game is a potential recruit to the
Dragon's cause.</p>

<p>If you arrive at a hunting location and find a party of firk'm
already there, absorb them into your group if convenient; alternate
pulls with them or find someplace else if not. You're not required
to acknowledge the incumbents as owning an entire hunting spot but
don't just take the whole camp away from them either. Good-natured
insults or loudly pointing out imaginary flaws in the firks' combat
techniques to your fellow Irekei are allowed as long as the firks
are not contacting you with "stop harassing me" messages or
otherwise obviously uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Do feel free to loot any grave you see. Wait until the firk has
released away if applicable.</p>

<p>Do as much in-character speech out loud as possible. If the
firk'm can't understand you, so much the better; direct them to our
website via /tell if they ask.</p>

<p><b>-Tyrranth Major</b><br>
Hunting parties on the mainland need to be aware of politics and
geography. Be prepared to be attacked at any time, but don't attack
neutrals without provocation. We do not collect tribute outside of
the desert unless at the direction of a guild officer. Try not to
make us new enemies, we've got plenty already, but feel free to
attack those who are already known hostiles.</p>

<p><b>-Burning Sands</b><br>

Always remember that there are lots of players who may not know
who we are, what we're about, or how they need to behave on our
lands. Talk first if there's any questions in your mind about
whether any given player or group knows the rules.</p>

<p>The rules are, in order of priority:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Known enemies may always be killed on sight. The list of known enemies may be found elsewhere.</li>
<li>Non-enemies should always be given warning and explanation before being attacked, unless you are certain that those individuals have already been warned of the relevant policy.</li>
<li>Fir'khanim may not approach Nkuru at any time. Any fir'khan who is west of the western zone line of Nkoth, and north of the northern zone line of Kharduun, is too close. Order them to leave;kill them if you fail to receive immediate compliance.</li>
<li>Hunting Irekei NPCs is never allowed in any zone. Firk'm observed doing this will be instructed to stop and turn over all stolen Irekei belongings (any valuable items you can carry, not just Irekei Leather) immediately on pain of death. If they fail to stop or if they return after a previous warning they should be killed without further ado. This applies especially to the Bladeweaver runestone holder (Lirek); no firk should be allowed to walk away with this rune.</li>
<li>Firk'm may not hunt in the Nkoth Waste north of Khar or in Kharduun at any time; they should be instructed to pay tribute AND leave the area immediately or be slain.</li>
<li>Firk'm may hunt non-Irekei spawns in the southern waste and on the eastern half of the continent without interference from Shadowclan; feel free to roleplay encounters in a hostile but
non-aggressive manner.</li>
<li>Always answer /tell requests for explanation to at least some extent. Direct them to our website if you don't have time or interest for a lengthy discussion.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<h2>DUELING</h2>

<p>You do not challenge a fellow Shadowclan Irekei directly. Instead, you must bring your challenge to an Irekei who holds higher rank than both you and your opponent, who will act as judge. After hearing your challenge and your opponent's response, the judge may rule to allow the duel, to disallow it, or to postpone it if there are more pressing matters at hand. The decision of the judge is final and cannot be appealed; if he rules there is no cause for a duel you may not challenge again for the same grievance. If the judge rules the challenge and timing are appropriate, the challengee may not decline the duel, although he may decline to defend himself.
<p>Urikhan (including jov'uus) may not be challenged to duels. Players of any rank may spar among themselves by mutual consent. Irikhan and above should remove headgear before doing so. Sparring inside Nkuru should take place inside an Ubhor'habat or atop the walls. Sparring is not considered a duel.
<p>Higher rank members may execute or order the execution of lower-rank members as punishment if needed; clan quality control should be contacted if this authority is abused. Execution is not considered a duel.
<p>The requirement for a higher-rank judge means that guild officers can neither challenge nor be challenged to duels. Challenges between unequal-rank opponents will in most cases be denied unless both parties are willing. Most duels will be between two Irikhan.
<p><b>Formalities:</b><br>
"<i>(judge), nu syk dukh</i>" This announcement is a request for the named player to act as judge in a duel.<p>
"<i>Qhe bhan'ov ov (challengee) must kham dukhaq uith khan</i>" This ritual statement names the person you are challenging and is the formal opening of a challenge to a duel; both judge and opponent must be present.
<p>The judge will then ask whatever questions he deems necessary to rule whether the duel is appropriate. If the challengee desires the duel as well, the duel will generally be approved. If he does not, then the judge will have to rule whether or not to order the duel based on the facts available and his own judgment. Misuse of rank in the form of repeated or blatant approval of unjust duels will result in demotion.
<p>The judge may announce his decision in one of three ways:<p>
"<i>Jov khan iko qhis</i>" The grievance is rejected and may not be brought again.<br>
"<i>Jov khan qhis sun</i>" Dueling is not currently allowed but the issue may be reopened at a more appropriate time.<br>
"<i>(challengee), lak must ansuer uith khan</i>" The duel is approved.
<p>The next response is the challengee's.
<p>"<i>Take nu' khan</i>" The challengee declines to defend himself; the challenger may attack immediately. The challenger may decline to attack, and may choose to stop short of death if he does attack. If the player remains facing his challenger after giving this response, then this is considered an apology, acknowledging that the grievance is justified. If the challengee turns his back on his challenger and responds, it is an insult saying that the challenger or the grievance is considered unworthy of recognition in the eyes of the challengee. Regardless, the duel is considered over and the grievance resolved once the challenger either kills their opponent or decides to not shed the blood of their Clanmate.
<p>"<i>Nu uill ansuer nou</i>" The duel should proceed immediately at the current location. Or, "Nu uill ansuer at (location)." The duelers and judge will move to the named location and proceed. The pit of a Dragon Temple such as in Nkur Uuskar is a favorite site. Players may buff themselves prior to the duel,summon pets, rest to full stamina/health/mana, and otherwise prepare themselves using their own abilities, but should not have any buffs from other players. Both participants should remove all armor and jewelry. Once both participants announce they are "redi", the judge will call "salut"; the combatants should face each other and salute. The salute may take many forms and need not be the standard salute social, but should involve something more than just drawing weapons. Tribes or Arkhakt may define their own ritual salutes.
<p>The judge will then call "<i>jalla</i>", and the fight begins. The only rules or restricted abilities during the duel are that no other player may heal, attack, or otherwise interfere; that no armor, jewelry, or scroll use is allowed; and that stealth and invisibilty are not permitted. The duel ends when one is dead; the victor should offer a salute to his fallen foe. Again, the grievance is considered resolved once the duel is over, regardless of who wins.</p>

<h2>Out-of-Game Behaviour:</h2>

<p>All Shadowclan members are expected to be mature in actions if
not years. Any immature behaviour by a Shadowclan Player reflects
