  <h3>Expectations of Members</h3>
  <h2>Roleplay and Conduct</h2>
  <p>Stay in-character - No references to the world outside of Lineage II. Use
    of the Orc or Dark Elf is strongly encouraged. (Note: If your character name
    is inappropriate you will not be allowed to join Shadowclan). </p>
  <p>Have fun without ruining the fun of others. </p>
  <p>Come prepared to learn. Due to the limit on guild size, we may not be able to accomodate you right way.
  However, after you are initiated, you ARE member of the clan, and are expected to conform to all Shadowclan rules.
   </p>
  <h6>NO EXPLOITS</h6>
  <p>Shadowclan members do not abuse bugs, cheats, external programs or ways to
    gain power or wealth that the developers of the game did not intend to be
    used.</p>
  <h6>LOYALTY</h6>
  <p>Shadowclan are fiercely loyal to their tribes, and the clan.  You may leave the clan whenever in your early stahe,
  however if you leave the clan after you have been initiated as a 'grunt', you will be labeled a traitor, and killed
  on sight.</p>
  <p>When you join Shadowclan, you will be joining a particular tribe.  Shadowclan is actually made up of these individual
  tribes.  What tribe you join is your choice, however most of the tribes may not have any open spaces, so you may have
  to settle for the tribe that has open slots.

  <h2>Rules for Shadowclan</h2>
  <h5>Chain of Command:</h5>
  <p>All characters are expected to follow the chain of command.</p>
  <p>See the Structure page for more information.</p>
  <h2>Out-of-Game Behaviour:</h2>
  <p>All Shadowclan members are expected to be mature in actions if not years.
    Any immature behaviour by a Shadowclan Player reflects badly on the guild
    as a whole, especially if done under the Shadowclan name or the character's
    name. </p>
