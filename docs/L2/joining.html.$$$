  <h3>Why Join?</h3>
  <p>Shadowclan is an open-membership guild dedicated to roleplaying a misunderstood, perhaps 'evil' race. 
	We started in Ultima Online as a guild of player-character Orcs;
    since then we have opened branches in numerous other games, always dedicated
    to playing a limited selection of 'evil' (or, rather, 'misunderstood') races,
    providing enjoyable enemies for the mainstream player to oppose. In Lineage II,
    we are Orcs and certain Dark elf classes, races who allied to fight the infestation of humans and elves. </p>
  <p>As a guild, we are dedicated both to high-quality roleplaying, and to highly
    effective PVP. We roleplay our character fully and at all times. We do not talk smack with our enemies; our
    goal is to create a vibrant, immersive, lore-compliant, and deadly nation. 
	Note that we do not automatically kill all the 'pinkis' on sight; we
    will collect tribute when convenient, and may occasionally even coordinate
    military actions with non-Shadowclan guilds against a common foe.</p>

  <h2>Dark Elves</h2>
  <p> Evil and aloof. Dark elves have been betrayed by humans and elves, 
  and thus hate them even more than the orcs do. 
  Dark elves have grown to distrust even dark elves in other clans. 
  They see orcs as primitive, and the dark elves allied with the 
  Shadowclan orcs do so to further their own ends. The alliance is 
  strong though, and though the two races taunt each other, there is 
  an underlying respect between the two races for each others strengths 
  and their willingness to work together. </p>
