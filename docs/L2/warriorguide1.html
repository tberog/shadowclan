  <p>This is mainly focused on heavy tank warrior with sword weapons, any weapon
    tha warrior gets mastery of would follow pretty much the same pattern. Dex
    warriors need an entirely different approach and guide.</p>
  <h5>Basic stuff</h5>
  <p><strong>ATR</strong> - Attack rating, formula is sword skill*4 + mastery
    skill*2 + dex/2. This is compared which the DEF of whoever you're trying to
    hit to determine sucess chance. <br />
    <strong>DEF</strong> - Not quite sure the formula, but it's based on the armour
    you're wearing's base DEF, and your wear armour skill for the type, DEX also,
    *shrug*. This compared with the ATR of the guy hitting you determines hit
    or miss. <br />
    <strong>STR</strong> - increase maximum weapon damage, also a big factor of
    wear armour skill (something like 2 STR = 1% addition to skill). Increase
    min damage on bows (only about half as effective as DEX) <br />
    <strong>DEX</strong> - increases DEF and ATR a bit, increase MAX damage for
    certain weapons (daggers, blade master, weaver, bows), the same way STR does
    for swords (and effects MIN on swords). <br />
    <strong>CON</strong> - Your HP and Stamina, get lots of it. <br />
    <strong>SPI</strong> - something those wimpy mages use *shrugs* <br />
    <strong>INT</strong> - Very useful, also your skill cap is 60 + INT. </p>

  <p> First thing is to drop your DEX and SPR down 5, don't need those. Next,
    traits, go for stat runes, Irekei warriors have low STR and CON compare to
    Dwarves or HGs, so we need to start making that up. None of the other traits
    are really good anyways. </p>
  <p>I take healthy as an ox, and warlord's page for +20 max con. You have room
    for 3 traits (10 runes max, race, class, profession, 2 stat max runes (more
    on that later), 2 discs, traits. Maybe you plan on taking 3 discs though,
    in which case you just take 2 traits. 3rd trait I suggest taking sellsword(5%
    sword), or the +5 STR rune (don't think it's possible to get the +10 after
    the 2 CON). If you need more points, you can lower STR, or INT also by 5 (not
    a big deal, since for the traits you buy, most of the cost is for increasing
    current stats). </p>
  <p>There's also the choice between 1h+shield, 2h, or dual wielding. You don't
    have to really choose between 1h+shield and 2h for a while if you're not sure,
    but if you want to dual wield, you need to buy the ambidex rune at creation
    (not sure if you can afford it as a 3rd rune after 2 CON, may need to cut
    a CON one down to +5).</p>

  <p><strong> 1-h + shield:</strong> This one gives you less damage than a 2 hander,
    but gives you a shield that gives a big DEF boost, and blocks well (especially
    arrows). A solid choice for a more conservative warrior who wants to stay
    alive a long time in battles. To take advantage of the extra DEF, you can't
    be in offensive stance, so that's even less damage.</p>
  <p><strong>2-hander:</strong> My favorite, extra damage! You also get more out
    of powers with this one (50% extra damage on a 200 dmg hit is more than 50%
    on a 125 hit). You don't have the extra blocking, so you're relying mostly
    on HP and resists to keep you going (which will still keep a warrior alive
    a long time. A warrior of this type isn't going to get much help from his
    DEF</p>
  <p><strong>dual wielding:</strong> Best way to kill stuff fast. Most damage
    output (you don't perfectly wield both swords though, offhand takes a damage
    penalty), you also get more ATR since the ATR bonus enchantments on both weapons
    stack. The cost is it's the least stamina efficient, costs 6 per round (opposed
    to 4 for a 2 hander), and you're getting a less than 50% more damage out of
    that 50% more stam cost). I don't like it much since stam is so important
    for us in big GvG battles especially.</p>

  <p><strong> Bounty hunter:</strong> Has player track, detect hidden (maxing
    at adept), and a snare (melee range, not very good compare to our weapon powers).
    The track is nice, detect hidden not very useful except against high rank
    2 rogues or lower.</p>
  <p><strong>Commander:</strong> Group damage bonus chant, group run speed chant,
    group stun break, ability to command siege engines (without special item).
    This one's a winner. The chants are probably lined up for a nerf soon, but
    it'll still be useful even if they get capped. </p>
  <p><strong>Huntsman:</strong> NPC tracking, grants bow skill, summon hunting
    wolf. NPC tracking isn't very useful in PvP (is for PvE, but a waste of points
    when it comes to what really matters). The wolfs are ok if you really want
    a pet. </p>
  <p><strong>Gladiator: </strong>Melee resist buff, ATR buff, heal. The resist
    and atr buffs are ok, trainable and last 60 seconds, good in a small engagement.
    The heal is useless (heals like 25 hp). A good choice. </p>

  <p> Ingame off monsters, these runes randomly drop (the stronger the monster,
    the higher the rune). When applied, they increase a stat's MAX number you
    can raise it. +5 and +10 are free. But starting at +15, it costs you 5 attribute
    points (if you don't have them, it brings you into negative). The +20 rune
    costs 6, +25 costs 7, best is +40 for 10. </p>

  <p><strong> Sword:</strong> &quot;Focus&quot; skill, raises ATR, damage, gives
    you powers, and access to better weapons. Can't go wrong getting is as high
    as possible, try for way past 100. <br />
    <strong>Sword mastery</strong>: Adds extra ATR when holding 1h sword weapons,
    also grants (better) powers. You need 50% sword skill to get it. <br />
    <strong>Great sword mastery:</strong> Same as sword mastery, but for 2h. Need
    50 skill to get it. <br />
    <strong>Parry:</strong> Chance of stopping melee attacks <br />
    <strong>Block: </strong>Chance of stopping melee attacks and arrows, requires
    shield. <br />
    <strong>Toughness:</strong> Every 1% adds 3 HP and more the higher the skill
    goes. It tops off at adding 6 HP per skill point.<br />
    <strong>Wear armour heavy:</strong> Increases DEF and is required for better
    armour. <br />
    <strong>Indomitable will:</strong> Stun, snare and root break power. Auto-trained
    to GM. <br />
    <strong>Challenge:</strong> PvE pull, needs 1 train only <br />
    <strong>Hold the line:</strong> <br />
    <strong>Shield bash:</strong> Trainable stun that becomes available once block
    skill is raised a certain amount. The more you train it, the longer it lasts.
    1h + shield warriors should definitely invest in it. </p>

  <p> Unlike most traditional fantasy (where young warriors are good, and young
    mages suck), SB is an opposite, and warriors aren't so great. Mages start
    doing high damage thanks to good INT and SPR stats, while most archers pump
    up their DEX early on. For a warrior, bring up your CON. This lets you survive
    better, and lowers the level at which you can actually start tanking well
    in PvE. Until then, just try and find groups with good archers and mages.</p>
  <p>At around lvl 15-20 you get enough HP to tank. You still don't do much damage
    though, mostly because you need to be in precise to hit anything (since most
    groups are fighting stuff at least a few levels higher than their chars).
    If you can get your hands on a weapon with a nice ATR bonus, you might be
    able to hit stuff while in normal or offensive stance which helps. Anyways,
    keep going at it, you pretty useless in PvP, but you can tank in PvE which
    at least contributes to groups (can't kill much though). </p>
  <h5>Character building: </h5>
  <p>By lvl 25 or so, you'll have maxed your your STR and CON, My advice is to
    bring INT up to at least 50. 60, even 70 is good. Now you need to get your
    hands on some of those +MAX stat runes. Get a +30 or even better one for CON,
    and a +20 or +25 one for STR, that'll last you to level 60. The rest is pretty
    straightforward, keep raising skills! You don't really need to spike, untill
    you get into high lvl 50s. </p>

  <p><strong> Bleeds:</strong> Last 5 mins, do 3-10 damage every 5 seconds. Very
    useful on casters, since it will interrupt their spells. Good on rogues also,
    prevents them from stealthing. </p>
  <p><strong>Attack speed debuffs:</strong> Lasts between 60-90 seconds, slows
    down weapon attack rates by over 50%. Good on melees and archers. </p>
  <h5>What to use: </h5>
  <p><em>Red blade</em>, you get it early, 2nd sword power, 5 stam bleed. <br />
    <em>Crossed blades</em>, 4th sword power, costs 15 stam, but attack speed
    debuffs are useful in PvE, and you need it to tank. You get better one at
    lvl 29. <br />
    <em>Crimson mist</em>, another good 5 stam bleed, sword mastery 21/lvl 21
    (like gut render, people with 2h swords can use it still) <br />
    <em>Riposte</em>, lvl 29, 40 sword mastery, 5 stam attack speed debuff. Even
    people using 2h should go for it. <br />
    <em>Trueson's taunt</em>, taunt power for PvE use. It won't get the monster
    on you if some guy has already gotten it down to half health, and you join
    in. But if say an archer started outdamaging you and it went after him, this
    can bring it back on you for a while. </p>
  <h5>Higher level PvE </h5>
  <p>Past mid rank 3, the warrior is much more of a complete package in PvE. Since
    monsters hit over 200, no one else can tank them. Also in offensive stance,
    you can outdamage most archers and mages. Depending on how good your healers
    are, you may not be able to last the entire fight. To pull you can use challenge
    power. The good thing about challenge is that it isn't impaired by lack of
    LOS. So if an orc is stuck in a hut, or behind a building, and you use it,
    he'll come out (sometimes teleports onto you if stuck). Challenge is a taunt
    power that adds agro, and it has longer range than xbow. </p>

  <p>So now you should know how to build your char, and be useful while doing
    it. Time to learn about what a warrior does in the REAL game of SB! </p>
  <p>In large GvG battles, the warriors job is to make a lot of noise, and get
    the enemy's attention focused on trying to take you down, while other, weaker
    classes do their work. 1 warrior isn't too effective at this, because he can
    easily be snared, rooted and finished off, but get 5 or more charging the
    enemy together, and they've got a real problem. So warriors role in GvG is
    mostly offensive. </p>
  <p>You can defend your archers and mages against enemy melee also, but it's
    a bit of a waste. Archers (with armour piercing bows) and mages are much better
    at killing them, us melee'ers would have trouble doing significant damage
    against their resists, so we are better on soft targets. </p>
  <p>Also, just a quick tip, if you're not hitting something, don't run around
    in combat mode. Stamina is life on the battlefield, so don't waste a point
    of it. Be careful with powers also, going nuts with them will quickly make
    you a sitting duck. In case you don't know, for faster stamina regen, sit,
    then enter defensive stance.</p>
  <p><strong>Vs mages:</strong> close distance, use bleed hack hack hack. Against
    flying mages it's a little trickier, best to just call out &quot;so and so
    is flying chan,&quot; for the archers and mages to take care of him. If you
    can't, and have nothing else to do, go into defensive stance and tank the
    spells. When he's out of mana and, then stam, he's yours.</p>
  <p><strong>Vs archers:</strong> these guys are tricky, in big GvG they can't
    run around the battlefield kiting us so easily (and if they try, just forget
    him and start hitting someone else), but in smaller engagements, they are
    a pain. If you train up indomitable will high, you could break scout snares,
    but it probably needs to be maxed since they are GM level like I said. Vs
    flying archers, just run or get help, you can't beat these guys. Only hope
    is to go into defensive stance and sit under him, and hope you can run him
    out of stamina (unlikely if he is ranger or scout). </p>
