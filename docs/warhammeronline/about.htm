<blockquote>
<p>Orcs and Goblins are the scourge of the Warhammer world, an unending tide of ferocious raiders. For every greenskin Waaagh! defeated on the field of battle, another arises to trample a swathe of destruction across the land. After all, Orcs and Goblins live to fight!</p>

<p>The Orcs are monsters -- big, green-skinned monsters that loom over Men, Elves, and Dwarfs. Orcs have no traditional allies and many enemies, but these facts do little to deter the greenskins from waging war. In fact, they're generally pleased that they have constant sources of enemies to fight.</p>

<p>Backing up the savagery of the Orcs are the Goblins, their smaller cousins. What these little greenskins lack in strength and toughness they make up for in cunning and trickery, and they form an important part of the green horde.</p>

<h2>Want to make an alternate character?</h2>

<p>Shadowclan was originally created as a guild for alternate characters (Ultima Online 1997 "Lets all make orc characters"). That tradition is carried over into Warhammer Online by allowing anyone to join without any special out of game applications or references. But Shadowclan has also grown to become a home for many players who play Shadowclan characters exclusively. We try and provide a fun and entertaining stop for players of all kinds, offering an alternative style of playing the game that you rarely find in other guilds.</p>




<h2>Joining the Clan</h2>

<p>Ready to try? Read our page about <a href="join.htm">creating a Shadowclan Greenskin</a>.</p>

<p>Once your character has been created, you should try and meet up with a clan member to make sure your character meets the standards. The Shadowclan Greenskins can be found on the Badlands server in Warhammer Online. Once you login with your Greenskins character, type in a <i>/who Shadowclan</i> command and send tells to any Shadowclan player you see online for an invite into the guild. It is recommnded that you look over the <a href="rules.htm">rules</a> and the <a href="language.htm">language</a> pages before asking for a guild invitation.</p>
