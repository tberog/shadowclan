		<br><br>It had been years since the grand protector had united the disparate clans of rodia. Since then, many changes had taken place, including the rise of peaceful rodians. This bothered the grand protector beyond measure, and it was apparent that the initial attempt to send all peaceful rodians off the planet could not stem the tide. With the lack of interclan warfare, many rodians had become complacent. There was a great need to protect the rodian way. 
	      <br><br>Through many sleepless nights, designs and plans formed in his mind, until one day, calling his advisors together, he announced his plan to save the rodian way.
		<br><br>"Da wars will start again." announced the grand protector, as he watched the shock on the face of his advisors. "Wih am sending our best warriors tu klomp dim trayturs dat wuld betray da rodian way, alung wid awl dihr frinds. Dim will gu tu awl kornurs uv da galaxies. Awl will fear rodia agin, agh dihr tayls will inspiyr da yung rodians uv da future. Gaddur da klans tugiddur, agh fiynd lats strongest klompurs." The advisors grunted submission even before his spittle had settled on the glistening floor, and quickly scurried away. 
		<br><br>A week was given, and some of the fiercest warriors rodia has ever seen were gathered at the star port. Rodians were shouting and grunting at the star port. The grand protector stood up and quickly the chanting stopped. "Du nub fail mih, nor lats clans, or rodia. Da future am in lats hands nuw. Kum bak viktors, ur kum bak flat. Dihr am nub uddur choice."

                  Shadowclan began in October 1997 when a handful of players in 
                  Ultima Online on the Great Lakes shard decided to take the place 
                  of the stupid AI monsters and provide a more intelligent enemy. 
                  They were the first Shadowclan Orcs, and lived out of a tent. 
                  From the beginning, they roleplayed and stayed in-character 
                  as orcs. <br><br>
                  Soon after that, Shadowclan moved to the Catskills shard and into 
                  the orc fort South of the City of Yew. The clan grew and thus did 
                  the intensity at the orc fort. Battles became commonplace. Other 
                  roleplayers flocked to Catskills, and with some publicity, the 
                  population of Shadowclan skyrocketed.
