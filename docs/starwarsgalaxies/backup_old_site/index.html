		<font color="#33ccff"><b>Having fun</b></font>
		<br><br> Key to being a Shadowclan member is having fun at what you are doing, without ruining the fun of others. We love to provide people with an enemy they enjoy fighting. 
		<br><br>
		<font color="#33ccff"><b>Roleplay</b></font>
	      <br><br>Shadowclan members are required to be in-character at all times while in-game. We specialize is non-human roleplay, especial orcs and creatures of similar behavior/mentality. 
		<br><br>
		<font color="#33ccff"><b>Open Membership</b></font>
		<br><br>
	      Anyone is welcome to join Shadowclan with a new character that conforms to Shadowclan policies. 
		<br><br>
		<font color="#33ccff"><b>Xenophobic</b></font>
		<br><br> Only rodians are members, and are often hostile to non-rodians, as well as very territorial.
		<br><br>
		<font color="#33ccff"><b>Respect</b></font>
		<br><br>
	      Shadowclan members are expected to be mature members of the player community, treating fellow players with respect. 
		<br><br>
		<font color="#33ccff"><b>Quality</b></font>
		<br><br>
	      We train our new members in the Shadowclan ways, and expect them to act appropriately. 
		<br><br>
		<font color="#33ccff"><b>Combat</b></font>
		<br><br>
	      If the game supports it, Player versus Player combat, as it fits within our roleplay, is a key part of Shadowclan. 
		<br><br>
		<font color="#33ccff"><b>Committed characters</b></font>
		<br><br>
	      While we have open membership, we expect characters in Shadowclan to join when their character is created and for that character to stay in Shadowclan. This promotes sharing and cooperation between members as they know that aiding their fellow members will be aiding Shadowclan. Traitors to Shadowclan are treated very poorly. This applies only to the character, not the player. You can join other guilds with non-Shadowclan characters.
            <br><br> 
            A trial period is given to a new member, by which they are deemed gruntees, and are evaluated to see if they are deemed worthy of the clan.  At such a time, they are given the grunt test, and must decide whether to pledge themselves to the clan, leave the clan.  Leaving the clan at such a time does not make them a traitor. 
		<br><br>
		<font color="#33ccff"><b>Game Friendly</b></font>
		<br><br>
	      Our storyline and background blend in with game's storyline and background to the highest degree possible. We won't force other players to break character in order to match our own roleplay style. We follow the rules of the game. No cheating, bug exploiting, illegal 3rd party programs, or other violations of the game's Terms of Service are ever allowed.

                  Shadowclan began in October 1997 when a handful of players in 
                  Ultima Online on the Great Lakes shard decided to take the place 
                  of the stupid AI monsters and provide a more intelligent enemy. 
                  They were the first Shadowclan Orcs, and lived out of a tent. 
                  From the beginning, they roleplayed and stayed in-character 
                  as orcs. <br><br>
                  Soon after that, Shadowclan moved to the Catskills shard and into 
                  the orc fort South of the City of Yew. The clan grew and thus did 
                  the intensity at the orc fort. Battles became commonplace. Other 
                  roleplayers flocked to Catskills, and with some publicity, the 
                  population of Shadowclan skyrocketed.
