        <p>What to wear, what to wear. Ussa often reminds usa self of an old
          dalninil who had entirely too large of a wardrobe. As often as that
          one would get lost in the goblin forests outside Cabilis, would nau
          surprise ussa at all if that one also got lost in her closet. Now where
          was ussa, oh xas, what to wear. Ussa have collected and worn all manner
          of clothing in the past. Some armor, some cloth, some leather, some
          shirts, some robes, and ussa could go on and on. But recently an abbil
          saw a painting of ussa wearing an old garment. They chuckled at it
          and then asked if ussa had more paintings of the former fashions that
          ussa have worn. </p>
        <p>This scroll will document some of the one's ussa has managed to dig
          up recently. Enjoy the visions of past and current fashion. Perhaps
          ussa will take new ones of ussa and place them here as well at a later
          time.</p>
        <p>Aluve for now abbils.</p>
