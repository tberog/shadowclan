            <h3>The Night of Shadows</h3>
            <blockquote><p>During the Lost Age, Humans mysteriously appeared in Norrath. The 
              rise of the Combine Empire angered many of the Gods of the elder 
              races. And none were angered more than Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate. 
              Innoruuk was proud of His children. He had fashioned them by first 
              destroying, and then recreating the first Elven king and queen in 
              his own image. The Tier'dal served Innoruuk well. But would even 
              they bring the whole of Norrath under Innoruuk's power...?</p>
            <p>Innoruuk watched these humans and decided that some of the hated 
              Light Gods must have conspired together and created these &quot;rivvel&quot; 
              (as He named them) for the specific purpose of controlling the whole 
              of Norrath. Innoruuk began to seethe with anger, and His anger grew 
              until He could no longer contain it. He released a howl of rage. 
              His children in Neriak cringed at the sound, some going mad, others 
              being robbed of their minds altogether. But as Innoruuk brought 
              Himself back under control He realized... did not some of the Ogres, 
              Iksar, and Trolls also cringe when they felt His outrage? In fact, 
              some of these races had elected to forsake their own God and worship 
              Him instead (and in turn some of Innoruuk's own children had chosen 
              to worship these other Gods, but Innoruuk rarely thought on that...).</p>
            <p>And then He knew how to ensure His domination over this world. 
              If His enemies under the Light could work together to create these 
              rivvel (He already accepted his theory as fact), then He would turn 
              Their idea against Them. But instead of spending centuries in the 
              wasteful creation of a new race, He would let his Tier'dal work 
              together with the other evil races to dominate the world. Innoruuk 
              knew His children were the most intelligent of these races and would 
              easily manipulate the others, especially those who already worshipped 
              Him. Innoruuk sent out a mental Call to the other Gods who He knew 
              would best suit his plan... Rallos Zek who controls the mighty Ogres... 
              Cazic Thule who controls the devious Trolls and the ancient Iksar. 
              In this Call was contained all that he wished them each to know 
              about his plan, the reasons behind it, the anger that drove Him 
              to it, how He despised the Light Gods who had created the rivvel 
              most of all... all this was contained in the Call, and more... for 
              he added as well those deceits, those manipulative promises which 
              He knew would turn Them to this dark alliance.</p>
            <p>Rallos Zek and Cazic Thule both agreed to make their children agreeable 
              to this idea of alliance. Innoruuk knew each of Them probably had 
              secret, selfish reasons for agreeing, but he did not care. Such 
              was His arrogance that he felt capable of manipulating them to his 
              ends no matter what happened... and the other Dark Gods were similarly 
              arrogant, for they believed the same thing...</p>
            <p>And so the Shadow Gods, as they would be called by those mortals 
              who would follow the path of the Shadowclan, wove Their alliance 
              with promises none of Them intended to keep. To Their followers 
              all the Shadow Gods sent a wave of immense, nearly mind-shattering 
              terror. The message of this dark alliance was received on a night 
              the scholars would later name, The Darkest Night, The Night of Terror, 
              The Night The Shadows Awoke. When the evil races recovered, the 
              strongest and most cunning of each began forming the Shadowclan, 
              devoted to bringing death, destruction, and eventual domination 
              over the light races. Each clan's leaders then prepared to contact 
              the other races so that they might all start down their path to 
              destiny...</p></blockquote>
            <h3>The Dark Prophet</h3>
            <blockquote><p>One of the best protected, yet non-magical items in the possession 
              of the Shadowclan is the original written account of the first description 
              of the Dark Prophet. This account was written by the first Oracle 
              of the Shadowclan, the great Troll Chugg, shaman of Cazic-Thule. 
              The Dark Prophet is the most honored mortal known to the clan. This 
              is the account written by Chugg, translated from Trollish to Common 
              speech...</p>
            <p>&quot;Tis the day after the Blessed Night when our destiny was 
              shown to us. Great was the pain we were given, and yet we long to 
              feel such pain again. Fear and Hatred spread over the whole of Norrath 
              is now the goal of the Shadowclan. This was the Message we received 
              from the Shadow Gods. But there was more to the message... meanings 
              still vague to me, and yet I must recall everything I can for I 
              seem to remember more than any of my brethren. Perhaps it is fitting 
              that the Oracle should translate this part of the Message, since 
              it would seem that the Oracle will forever be the interpreter of 
              the Dark Prophet's words. That was part of the Message, but there 
              was more...</p>
            <p>Guide us, he will, this Dark Prophet. But he shall not rule. He 
              will bless the Shadowclan with some sort of link to the thoughts 
              of our Gods, and yet we will not understand. How can this be? I 
              must think on it until it becomes clearer. I must recall the vision 
              exactly...</p>
            <p>A large Ogre who is not an Ogre stands upon a large stone, taller 
              even than himself. And all about this rock are seated Troll, Ogre, 
              and Tier'dal. The Dark Prophet speaks... no, babbles mostly. It 
              seems his words almost hold meaning, but that meaning dances just 
              out of reach. And then he is an Ogre no more, and one of the Tier'dal 
              stands upon the stone, but he is not Tier'dal. Still he rants and 
              screams at the gathering. Looks of confusion surround him. We do 
              not understand. Finally he subsides into incomprehensible mutterings 
              and he is carefully led away by shaman caretakers and warrior guards. 
              As he descends from the stone his shape changes again into that 
              of a Troll, but he is not a Troll, and then he is led away. Then 
              a smallish Troll wearing a mask climbs the stone. Is it me? I cannot 
              be sure. He shouts at the same gathering, trying to make sense of 
              what they have heard. And as he finishes a great cheer rises from 
              the gathering. Surely this is an important event, and one that does 
              not often occur...</p>
            <p>So this Dark Prophet who is not Ogre, nor Troll, nor Tier'dal, 
              but takes the form of all these races will give us his prophecies, 
              and they shall guide us. But there must be one among us who can 
              make sense of the Dark Prophet's meaning. And where can this Dark 
              Prophet be found? He seems mad. He obviously needs our care if he 
              will survive. And survive he must. We must find this Dark Prophet 
              quickly, for we cannot even consider what would happen to us if 
              he were first found by rivvil...&quot;</p></blockquote>
            <h3>The Coming of Chaos, The Light's revenge</h3>
            <blockquote><p>For years the Gathering of Evil grew slowly in strength as their 
              dark union became know by more and more of the chosen evil ones 
              throughout the lands. The Clan of Shadows began to spread it's destructive 
              might across Norrath. They began to tread upon the lands of the 
              hated Rivvil and the light elves. Skirmishes were a common place 
              as the Clan spread. The Clan of Shadows would even begin to encroach 
              upon the planes of the gods! Once the rivvel became aware of the 
              true threat which the Clan was becoming there was cause for alarm 
              amongst the races of light. The brutish savages that composed Shadowclan 
              were on the verge of obtaining the many artifacts of power from 
              the realms of the dark gods themselves. </p>
            <p>This was something the light races could not allow. They mustered 
              their leaders and sages and devised an impressive plan... they would 
              use the dark ones evil tendencies against themselves. A few well 
              placed enchantments ad charms would plant the seeds of greed and 
              dissension. The light races cheered at their own brilliance and 
              went about preparing this scheme. As the light races had hoped, 
              the dark ones were not expecting such an attack. They would be rewarded 
              beyond their wildest expectations time will show.</p>
            <p>The Clan of Shadows took little time in breaking into squabbles 
              over treasure, power, rightful places in the land, rights, and other 
              such matters... all things imaginable that would cause strife within 
              the great army and lead them to battle themselves.. shattering the 
              alliance that had been formed. Many would be slain, lost, or worse 
              they would be turned into the traitorous pawns of the light races... 
              the ultimate irony one might say. The troubles would continue in 
              this time of Chaos for may months as the clan battled amongst itself 
              and the few who began to understand what had transpired struggled 
              to stop the carnage. Eventually a calm came to the Chaos... a few 
              strong leaders managed to restore order from the chaos. The leaders 
              were not of any particular quota of the evil races this time, the 
              old order shattered by the chaos. Now the leaders would be of any 
              of the dark races, their ability would be their strength. The old 
              legends of the Dark Prophet were lost in the time of Chaos... and 
              the few who do remember, believe the Prophet Dead. There is a new 
              sense of purpose overcoming the Clan of Shadows as they recover 
              from the bloodlust which had overcome them all... REVENGE.</p>
            <p>The Shadowclan's new leaders began to discuss the events which 
              led to them being where they are now.... their numbers crippled 
              by the events of the Time of Chaos. They began to draw up a long 
              list of their enemies, gather charts and maps and begin to prepare 
              a course of action. A purpose was determined and the tools needed 
              to accomplish this purpose were considered. The creation of a powerful 
              army would be necessary in order to extract vengeance on the light 
              races as well as to be prepared for any other attacks from unexpected 
              places. With the spiritual guidance of the Oracle, whose Seer like 
              powers would show the clan the path that the gods would have the 
              Clan of Shadows travel. A leader of the Horde would need to be appointed.. 
              one whose existence was to wage war.. the Shadowlord would be found 
              and then the journey down the road to vengeance would begin.....</p></blockquote></td>
