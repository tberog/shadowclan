            <p><strong>Q. What should I fight if I'm blah level?</strong><br>
              A. You need to look for monsters that are your level or lower. To 
              do this you need to target them, and hit enter to go to &quot;chat&quot; 
              mode/ Then type command [/consider], that will tell you what approximate 
              level a monster is. At first level all monsters should be a &quot;Even 
              fight&quot; to text will be white. As you progress in levels the 
              monsters &quot;cons&quot; will change color. At first level you 
              will have three color &quot;cons&quot;. White (even fight), Yellow 
              (Gamble), and Red (Tombstone).</p>
            <p><strong>Q. How do I setup up autorun?</strong><br>
              A. To do this go to small window mode by hitting F1. Then in the 
              lower right hand corner, you will see a button labeled RUN. Click 
              it once. Now you are running.</p>
            <p><strong>Q. How to I put things in my hotkey list?</strong><br>
              A. This one is a little tricky; you need to find the button you 
              want to make a hot key. Let's say you want your spells on a hotkey 
              so you can meditate fast. Go to small window again, and look for 
              the button that is labeled spells. Place your cursor over the spells 
              button and left click and hold down the mouse button. After a few 
              seconds, a box called spells will appear in your cursor. Take the 
              upper left hand corner of it and move it to the bunch of boxes in 
              the bottom left hand part of your screen. Put the corner of it in 
              the first box. Click - now you have your spells labeled as the number 
              1. To test this, hit the 1 key and you should go to your spellbook.</p>
            <p><strong>Q. How can I kill a skeleton? They seem too hard?</strong><br>
              A. There are many kinds of skeletons. If you're first starting out, 
              look for decaying skeletons. All the others will kill you until 
              about 5th level or so.</p>
            <p><strong>Q. How do I fish?</strong><br>
              A. You need a fishing pole. You also need some bait. Then you need 
              a body of water. Go to your actions box and look for fishing. Under 
              skills. All races have the skill. Equip the fishing pole, and then 
              get by a body of water. Click the fishing button. Hoowah!! Now your 
              fishing!.</p>
            <p><strong>Q. I keep drowning when I jump in the water...why?</strong><br>
              A. You need to look up when swimming..I use mouse look to do this. 
              Refer to your manual to see how to mouse look. I use the mouse2 
              button for mouse look. Just look up and move like normal. You can 
              now swim to your hearts content.</p>
            <p><strong>Q. How can I tell if something is too tough?</strong><br>
              A. Refer to the question about what can I fight</p>
            <p><strong>Q. How do I join or make a group?</strong><br>
              A. To join a group, you need somebody to group with. I will assume 
              you already have this. Let's have you invite them into your group. 
              First target them, and then go to small window mode. Then look for 
              the button that is labeled &quot;INVITE&quot;, then click it. You 
              just sent them an invite to join a group with you. You can keep 
              adding people to your group, up to 6 people can be in a group at 
              one time. Now to let you get added in a group when you get an invite. 
              Remember that label for invite? Well, now its called &quot;JOIN&quot;. 
              When you see in the chat box &quot;So-and-so has invited you to 
              join his/her party&quot;, go back to small window and that label 
              that was for invite, is now called Join. Click it and you're in 
              their group.</p>
            <p><strong>Q. How do you make group talk?</strong><br>
              A. Once again, go to small window mode. Then click on where your 
              chat box is. You will see some tabs for all kinds of chat filters. 
              One of them is for group speak. Click the box and now you're in 
              group speak. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. What should I use my starting training points on if I 
              am a blah?</strong><br>
              A. This is kind of up to you. But it helps to put your starting 
              points into your weapon skill. You might at later levels start saving 
              your points for some trade skill. But that's all up to you.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. How do you make OOC broadcasts? auctions? Shouts?</strong><br>
              A. /ooc (Whatever)<br>
              /Auction (Blah blah blah)<br>
              /shout (Blah blah blah)<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. What should I watch out for as a newbie in Neriak? Grobb? 
              Ogguk? </strong><br>
              A. Once again look at the question about what I should fight. But 
              some things that can be a problem (read instant death at first level) 
              are (In Neriak), Black bear, young kodiak, skeleton, Zombie, Lesser 
              Mummy. In Innothule swamp, you have all kinds of things that will 
              kill you. Don't stay there. From the town head left along the wall, 
              and look for the entrance to Feerrott. In there are lots of things 
              to kill. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. How can I talk to just one person? </strong><br>
              A. /tell (Name) (Blah blah blah)<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. How do I know if you are online?</strong><br>
              A. /who all (Name) <br>
              This will tell you if I am online and tell you where I am, assuming 
              I am not anonymous<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. What is the best race to play?</strong><br>
              A. Why dark elf of course...What race is better then us? We are 
              masters of all we survey! (Just kidding, they're all balanced just 
              fine)<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. What is the most powerful race and class combination? 
              (thought you'd like this one)</strong><br>
              A. None. See above question<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. How can I speed up the process of memorizing spells? 
              </strong><br>
              A. This comes at 4th level for a true spell caster and at 8th level 
              for a priest. A hybrid gets it at 15th<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. Does sitting down speed up my mana regeneration? </strong><br>
              A. Yep<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. When I am fighting in a group with higher level people 
              it seems they keep getting more experience points. Is this true 
              and if so, why?</strong> <br>
              A. They are getting more exp. then you. But you get the same hard 
              movement on your exp. bar that the highest level person gets. So 
              if you kill a tombstone monster and the highest level person gets 
              his exp. bar moved by 1/5th of a bar..You will also move 1/5th of 
              a bar.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. Do my spells get stronger the higher level I get or do 
              I need stronger spells?</strong><br>
              A. Yes to both. Spells do get stronger, but you will also need to 
              get new spells. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. I moved something from a creature's body and dropped 
              it on my body and now I can't find it in my inventory. What happened 
              to it? (Hint: message says: No room, Item has been dropped to ground)</strong><br>
              A. Ummm...Its on the ground silly :P<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. What do the guards do in the woods?</strong><br>
              A. If your in trouble...Bring your monster there, and they should 
              take care of it for you. Just make sure you are going to a guard 
              of your race..<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. What's a &quot;faction&quot;? </strong><br>
              A. A faction is how a certain race feels about your race/class. 
              For example, as a dark elf cleric, I am allowed to trade with the 
              human merchants that dwell in East commons, but if I was a dark 
              elf Necromancer, I would be KOS (Kill On Sight) to them. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. Do factions matter? (remember Troll SKs are KOS in the 
              Ogre Warrior training area)</strong><br>
              A. Oh yes they do! I have a story for you. There was a person in 
              P3 that was a dark elf. This person thought it would be a good idea 
              to go help some humans kill the guards that wander the forest in 
              Neriak.. After a while of doing this, and making some good money 
              from the loot of the guards, he walked back to town. Little did 
              he know that now he was unwelcome in Neriak. All guards would attack 
              him on sight. Killing some monsters will raise your faction in one 
              place. While lowering it to others. For example, if I am a dark 
              elf Necromancer, and I go to east commons and kill orcs, after a 
              while I will be able to go into the city of Freeport <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. Does my selection of a god matter?</strong><br>
              A. Yes, some people will not like you do to your god. And others 
              will like you better do to your god. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. Does intelligence help me advance quicker?</strong> <br>
              A. It helps your skills advance faster. A dark elf warrior will 
              hit the level/skill cap faster then a Brute will. This allows the 
              Dark elf to be able to keep several weapon skill up to max. So he 
              could use both two handed slash (Two-handed sword), and One hand 
              slash (long sword). <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. What does that &quot;bash&quot; skill do?</strong><br>
              A. Bash for ogres/trolls is a free attack they get in addition to 
              their normal attack. It can also at higher skill stun a monster 
              for a few seconds.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. How do I control my pet?</strong> <br>
              A. There are several commands you can give your pet.<br>
              <br>
              /Pet follow<br>
              /Pet sit down (this puts your pet in a relaxed state and he wont 
              wander around. He will still get up if you are hit)<br>
              /Pet kill (go get him pet!!)<br>
              /Pet back off (commands your pet to back out of combat. If not given 
              a pet will follow a fleeing monster. Not good in you are in a dungeon 
              and the monster gets some friends.<br>
              More can be found in your manual.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. How can I sew/use forge/cook/brew etc.?</strong> <br>
              A. Please refer to Kargrath's &quot;How do I use a trade skill&quot;<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. When I die will I lose a level?</strong> <br>
              A. You don't lose any exp. until 5th level. And you don't lose much 
              at first. Later on in levels you will lose more and more. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. Do I need to eat? What happens if I don't?</strong><br>
              A. You eat your food automatically, and if you don't, you will stop 
              getting back Hps/Mana/Stamina<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. As a dark elf necro, what should I be killing at levels 
              5-8? </strong><br>
              A. Please refer to question about what to fight.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. Do necros get pets other than the generic skeleton?</strong><br>
              A. Your pet will get more attacks, do more damage, and have more 
              HPs as you get new pet spells. But it's going to look like a skeleton 
              until they change that.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. At what level do necros get bind? (I looked through the 
              spell list on eqvualt about a month ago and didn't see it there)</strong> 
              <br>
              A. Bind Affinity, is gained at level 12 for all true casters, and 
              at level 14 for priests. Hybrids don't get it. <br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. What places (such as cities) should I avoid?</strong><br>
              A. This depends on what race you are. For now, try to stick the 
              three cities we all know. Neriak (Dark elves), Grobb (Trolls), and 
              Oggok (Ogres). All of us are welcome in each other's cities. You 
              might want to watch out though..I hear that Ogre warriors are not 
              friendly.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. What should I look out for while there?</strong><br>
              A. Keep using the /con command on NPCs in cities. If they're not 
              indifferent then leave them alone.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. At what level Should I start grouping?</strong><br>
              A. You can start grouping from day one if you want to. But it might 
              be best to wait until level 5 or so, when you can really get an 
              advantage out of the grouping. Low levels are easy to ready. I was 
              able to make second level in 15 min.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. How do I add this jerk to my ignore list!!!</strong><br>
              A. Go to chat, then type /Ignore (Jerks name)<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. How do I take someone off of my ignore list?</strong><br>
              A. Repeat the process. You will un-ignore them.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. Ummm, Just how do I add them to my friend's list?</strong><br>
              A. Hit enter to go to chat, then type /Friend (Name) Bingo, they're 
              now a friend. Note: you may only have 20 friends at one time.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. Ok, now how do I see if they're online?</strong><br>
              A. Go to chat again, then type /who all friend.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Q. Who should I have on my friend's list?</strong><br>
              A. Whoever your friends are silly.</p>
