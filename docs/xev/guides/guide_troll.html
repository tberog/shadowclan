            <blockquote> 
              <p>malicious, angry, primitive</p>
              <p>Trolls are vile creatures born in the harsh environment of the 
                Innothule Swamps. They are primitive savage creatures, evil intelligent 
                beasts. They prefer to be solitary, and have an extreme dislike 
                for following the orders of others. Trolls speak a primitive tongue 
                that is hard to understand even by those who are well versed in 
                the language. They distrust other races thinking that they can 
                only trust themselves.</p>
              <p>Trolls are the monsters that mothers tell their children about 
                while putting them to bed. They view both animals and intelligent 
                creatures as an equal source of food. Trolls are careful to stay 
                down wind while stalking their prey and can move with surprising 
                stealth for there size and bulk.</p>
              <p>They prefer dark and dank environments. And are always on the 
                look out for caves and crevices to call there own. Humans refer 
                to such places as &quot;Troll Holes&quot;. Troll Holes are filthy 
                places were few living things will go, a Troll will live out of 
                a single cave or crevice until the entire surrounding area has 
                been depleted of food.</p>
              <p>On the battlefield trolls are usually disorganized and chaotic. 
                They rarely follow orders and when they do it's usually by accident. 
                They are terrifying opponents to face, their predatory instincts 
                often drive them to attack the weakest members of an opposing 
                army, which is often the mages and clerics. Many also fear them 
                for their regenerative abilities... it is said that a troll can 
                never truly be killed. That given enough time they will always 
                come back no matter how horrible the injuries... they're right.</p>

            <blockquote> 
              <p>Troll Shadow Knights are the very definition of independence. 
                Even when in a group they will often stand apart from the crowed 
                thinking and plotting. Unlike other Trolls, Shadow Knights have 
                a thirst for power and even less respect for authority than most 
                Trolls. For some, their disrespect is so great that they disdain 
                the very gods that give them power. If a Troll Shadow Knight could 
                figure out how, he would rule the world. And if he couldn't rule 
                it, he would destroy it. Troll Shadow Knights are more intelligent 
                about worldly things such as mechanics and magic than most warriors, 
                they are also by far the most arrogant of Trolls. Some even refusing 
                to speak any language other than there own, being unwilling to 
                degrade themselves so much. Many Troll Shadow Knights use magery 
                in battle to weaken and cripple their opponents before the first 
                blow has been thrown. Troll Shadow Knights enjoy the suffering 
                of others, and are not above torture. In fact, they're quite good 
                at it.</p>
              <p><strong>How to role play a Troll Shadowknight:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>You are a dangerous loner with no respect for any authority 
                  but your own</li>
                <li>You will put more thought into an attack than most trolls</li>
                <li>You will never show weakness in front of anyone, including 
                  yourself</li>
              </ul>

            <h3><a NAME="shaman"></a>Shaman:</h3>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>The world is a strange and magical place for a primitive race 
                of people, but the Troll Shaman has the answer to all its mysteries. 
                Troll Shaman are con men with magical powers, unfortunately they 
                believe there own con. They seek to explain the forces of nature 
                through their gruesome rituals. Shaman make other Trolls uneasy, 
                which is exactly how they want it.</p>
              <p>They can read ones future by looking at the palm of his palm, 
                spitting into a bowl of bile, studying the directions that bodies 
                fall on the battle field, casting bones on the ground, contemplating 
                their naval, looking at the stars, dreaming... There are hundreds 
                of ways to see the future, and the Shaman knows them all.</p>
              <p>As if that weren't enough every Troll Shaman has a spirit helper, 
                this spirit helps guide the Shaman into understanding his visions. 
                Most spirits helpers are either animals or Trolls long since dead. 
                Shaman will often times speak to their helper as plainly as they 
                would to anyone. Their helper can tell them many things and will 
                often times be a great source of inspiration to a Shaman.</p>
              <p>When a truly grand vision is necessary a Troll Shaman will mix 
                a powerful drink known as &quot;Grol&quot;, it is made from various 
                mushrooms and berries that are found within the swamp. After drinking 
                it, if the Shaman survives he will often times have the truly 
                amazing vision he was searching for, but will also have lost a 
                little bit of his sanity as well... Perhaps forever.</p>
              <p><strong>How to role play an Troll Shaman:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>You must search for answer to your questions, at all costs!</li>
              <li>Listen to your spirit guide, he would never lie...</li>
              <li>If you don't know it, Fake it!</li>
              <li>You may now knowingly worship your god, revere your spirit guide 
                above all!</li>
              <li>Beware the power of Grol, if it is taken to liberally one may 
                forever loose there sanity and be forever trapped in a &quot;vision&quot;.</li>

            <blockquote> 
              <p>In the primitive and instinctive minds of Trolls one word stands 
                out above all the rest, &quot;survive&quot;... survival at all 
                costs. The best way to stay alive is to kill the competition, 
                these are words that the Troll Warrior has taken to heart. Troll 
                Warriors are just as clever as their Shadow Knight and Shaman 
                counterparts. But they have an advantage, Warriors are more willing 
                to work as a team. Warriors will often times form small hunting 
                packs that seek out and destroy the &quot;competition&quot;. Every 
                member of the pack looks out for himself and only himself, but 
                there is still much safety in numbers. Once the pack grows tired 
                of killing it will disband and its members will usually forget 
                each other.</p>
              <p>Groups of five or six Troll Warriors (occasionally accompanied 
                by a Shadow Knight or Shaman) roam the countryside killing the 
                weak and the sick. If they can catch you, you're food. This is 
                part of the reason trolls are so hated, packs are dangerous. While 
                leaders are rare within a pack the members seem to fight with 
                one mind, all traveling in the same direction and ALWAYS fighting 
                the same opponent, targeting the small and weak first. Children 
                do not leave their homes when a pack is in the area. And when 
                they do they are rarely seen again.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>The enemy must die, first the weak then the strong.</li>
                <li>Who is more important than yourself? No one!</li>
                <li>Be more willing to work in a group, but stay an individual.</li>
