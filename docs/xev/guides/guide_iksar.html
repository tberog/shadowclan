            <h3><a NAME="description"></a>Description:</h3>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>The Iksar are a proud race of lizard-like creatures created by 
                the great god Cazic-Thule far back in the Elder age, near the 
                dawning of time. In the early days, the Iksar were tribal in nature, 
                forming small pockets of themselves upon their vast continent 
                of Kunark. After many many years the Lizards came together into 
                a vast empire that spanned the entire continent. This was done 
                under the war hero turned emperor, Tharakus the Fist. The emperor 
                was a cruel and jealous sort, and ruled with an absolute power. 
                None dared oppose him. It was this simple fact that kept him from 
                bearing offspring (he was concerned that they would mature and 
                covet the seat of power for their own) and so when he died many 
                years later, the great empire fell apart to the squabbling of 
                many warlords, all seeking the title of &#8220;Emperor&#8221;. 
                Eventually the peoples of Iksar spread out and were lost to antiquity. 
                Some formed great City-States such as Cabilis while others traveled 
                nomadically. Even today traces of this vast power can be seen 
                in all reaches of Kunark.</p>
              <p> War and Bloodshed are the bread and wine of their lives. As 
                such only the classes geared towards warfare are available to 
                the Iksar: Warrior, Shadowknight, Monk, Necromancer, and Shaman.</p>
              <p> The Iksar are an intelligent race of Lizards whose entire history 
                and daily lives involve fighting, warfare, and conquest. They 
                are undoubtably some of the most powerful melee fighters in the 
                world. They are proud bordering on arrogant, and tend to be viscious 
                and cruel. This stems from their belief that they were the first 
                of all intelligent races on Norrath. They have no great respect 
                for those who wield magic (other than shaman, that is &#8220;god 
                magic&#8221; and therefor sacred) as they consider them physically 
                weak, and strength is all to the Iksar. Even amongst their own 
                kind Necromancers are outcasts, tho still respected for the power 
                they wield. They do not tolerate failure or weakness in any form, 
                and either offense is often met with a swift death. Quick to anger 
                but with long memories to bear grudges, they are not someone you 
                want against you. Iksar tend to become venerable (read: weaker) 
                at or near 140 years old, at which point they will leave their 
                family, lands, and titles behind and go off to die in private, 
                with dignity. Ritual suicide is not uncommon amongst the elder 
                of the Iksar, and is considered preferable to being seen weak 
                and frail with age.</p>

            <h3><a NAME="monk"></a>Monk:</h3>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Iksar are the only race other than human that can be this powerful 
                class. Monks are the undisputed champs of dealing melee damage. 
                Having a wide array of extra abilities makes this a fun and powerful 
                class to play. Unlike the warrior, monks do not encumber themselves 
                with heavy equipment, preferring to be agile and light.</p>
              <p><strong>How to role play a Iksar Monk:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>You deal out more melee damage than any other class. Period.</li>
                <li>You have the ability to focus your spirit to mend your own 
                  wounds.</li>
                <li>You can &#8220;feign death&#8221; fooling your opponent to 
                  leave you alone.</li>
                <li>You are one of the best classes to &#8220;Pull&#8221; in the 
                  game. Meaning bringing creatures back to your group to fight.</li>
                <li>You require very little in the way of equipment to be effective. 
                  Your body is a weapon.</li>
                <li>You rely on evading damage rather than absorbing it like the 
                  warrior. The downside is you do not have many hit points.</li>
                <li>Strength and Agility are very important to the monk.</li>
              </ul>

            <blockquote> 
              <p>Shunned by even their own people, the Iksar Necromancer cares 
                little for his people or their opinions of him. Power is all that 
                he seeks, power over the living through the use of the dead. He 
                knows that his own people fear him, and he derives a great pleasure 
                and satisfaction from this knowledge.</p>
              <p><strong>How to role play a Iksar Necromancer:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>You can summon an undead creature to fight your battles.</li>
                <li>You can cast powerful magics that tear the lifeforce away 
                  from your opponent to heal your own wounds.</li>
                <li>You can cast Damage over Time (DOTs) spells to destroy any 
                  who dare oppose you.</li>
                <li>Intelligence is of great importance to the Necromancer. </li>

            <blockquote> 
              <p>The shadowknight is a powerful union that is halfway between 
                the necromancer and the warrior. Shadowknights are able to wield 
                excellent weapons and wear protective armor, but have the added 
                bonus of being able to cast Necromantic spells (tho at a lower 
                level than a true necromancer) </p>

                <li>Has the ability to focus energy into a harmful blow to his 
                  opponent called &#8220;Harmtouch&#8221;</li>
                <li>At higher levels can summon pets to aid you in battle</li>

              <p>The spiritual leaders of their culture, the Shaman play a unique 
                role. They act as spiritual guide and leader, as well as strengthen 
                the troops with their great and powerful magic. They are a powerful 
                addition to the forces of the Iksar and are respected greatly 
                by their peerage. </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Your magic can easily swing the tide of any battle. You have 
                  the ability to &#8220;buff&#8221; the melee fighters to be far 
                  better than they could normally be.</li>
                <li>One of your most powerful line of spells allows you to slow 
                  a creatures attack.</li>
                <li>You possess extremely powerful Damage Over Time spells (or 
                  DOTs) that can cause considerable damage to your opponent.</li>
                <li>You can cast spells that will heal yourself or others.</li>
                <li>At higher levels you can summon a pet to aid you in your battles.</li>
