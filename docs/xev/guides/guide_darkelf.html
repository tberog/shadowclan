            <blockquote> 
              <p>small, smart, snobbish</p>
              <p>Dark Elves, dark of skin and dark by nature. They often follow 
                evil purposes, devoting themselves fanatically to secret causes. 
                Though they are weak in body, they are strong in the use of magic. 
                Dark Elves and elves hate one another passionately, for there 
                are ancient enmities between the two races. The two are fey cousins, 
                however, and share an enormously long life span. Barring an accidental 
                or violent death, Dark elves will normally live until they tire 
                of life.</p>
              <p>Dark elves plan their attacks down to the last person standing 
                and what spell they should cast at what time. They have the Mind 
                power and they use it effectively. They think of Ogres and Trolls 
                as Pawns in there over all plans. They simply have to influence 
                the right person and they can get almost anything they want done. 
                Dark elves are said to be able to manipulate the gods if they 
                so desired.</p>

              <p>Death, Destruction, Hate, and healers of life are an odd combination 
                of the powers that is given to the devoted Priests of Innoruuk. 
                Some put us in the same category as the Necromancer. That can&#8217;t 
                be farther from the truth. The Necromancer is a formidable ally 
                also bearing the powers of their deity but they are the masters 
                of death and decay and use their powers to forward that cause. 
                With undead creatures being at your mercy, you can slay them with 
                ease. Priests of Innoruuk help the warriors of our cause with 
                healing and aid, or causing the destruction to those who stand 
                in the way of Innoruuk&#8217;s will. Innoruuk (The prince of Hate) 
                has given those of strong belief in him a portion of his mighty 
                powers to use in battle and to heal those fighting for his ultimate 
                cause. We also have strength and a fighting ability to match some 
                of the best warriors around. Our motivations are our dying beliefs 
                in Innoruuk and his powers that some day he will take us to serve 
                him personally on his plane of existence. Our drive as Dark Elf 
                Priests is to become the one true power under our god. To use 
                others in our climb to the top and crush those that stand in our 
                way.</p>
              <p><strong>How to role play a Dark Elf Cleric:</strong></p>
              <blockquote> 
                <p>The first thing to know, and I say this from experience, is 
                  that your Wisdom must be high. Yes, you can crack that cracked 
                  staff over something&#8217;s head with great strength, but people 
                  rely on your skills to keep them alive during combat. So with 
                  your intelligence and strength combined, you will do the job 
                  that Innoruuk has sent you to do. Some say your disadvantage 
                  is your evilness, but think of that as being your advantage. 
                  (evil grin)</p>
                <p>As a priest of Innoruuk, you&#8217;re expected to keep those 
                  around you alive, but don&#8217;t let this become your sole 
                  purpose in life. You also have personal goals to fulfill, and 
                  quests to go on too. But while you&#8217;re with your brethren, 
                  do pay close attention to detail. Learn for yourself what works 
                  best, when to heal and when to kill. You&#8217;re not a magician, 
                  so get in the battle if you can, but keep track of those around 
                  you, don&#8217;t let them die. I, personally, will take a few 
                  good whacks at the enemy, then back out and start healing my 
                  warriors if they need it. Once I find that I can&#8217;t heal 
                  anymore, I yell my warning to those trusting their lives to 
                  me, as loudly as I can, and with great meaning. I jump into 
                  battle again, hitting the enemy with all my might, letting out 
                  great roars with every blow. I find that I can do as much if 
                  not more damage than those fighting alongside me, so why be 
                  afraid to fight just because I can cast spells? Depending on 
                  how the battle is going, I may even find myself sitting in the 
                  midst of it all to say a quick prayer to Innoruuk. Praying that 
                  He might bless me with just one more healing to save a dying 
                  comrade of mine, or that I might have just one more blast at 
                  my prey in hopes of slaying the beast. The priest is usually 
                  the one who calls for retreat, then may or may not stay behind 
                  to ensure the safety of others. Earn the trust and respect of 
                  others so that you will be able to make this call effectively. 
                  Calling for retreat is a big decision, and shouldn&#8217;t be 
                  done with haste.</p>
                <p>After a long hard battle, you&#8217;ll most likely feel the 
                  need to find a quiet spot to sit and pray to Innoruuk&#8230;to 
                  not only thank Him for allowing you success, but to also ask 
                  for more power so that you may continue to follow his command 
                  successfully.</p>
                <p>May your hatred be your guide..</p>

              <p>Parchments have been uncovered which cronicled the teachings 
                of Former Elder Lifebane</p>
              <p>*A green haze drifts near the great maw on a mountainside, a 
                place known as Neriak the evil home of the Dark elves of Norrath 
                The green haze drifts near the entrance and slows to a stop near 
                a large fallen tree. The silence of the night is broken as a low 
                growl is heard from the green haze, and a being begins to take 
                form.... a dark elf slowly becomes more and more solid as the 
                green haze disappears, drawn back within the dark elf's flesh*</p>
              <p>Arrrgh... the pains of transitioning back into the living.... 
                perhaps being non-corporeal does have some benefits.</p>
              <p>*The dark elf looks around the nearby mountainside, admiring 
                the entrance to his native home of Neriak, feeling safe now that 
                he is once again under the protection of the Neriak Guards, the 
                beasts shall not bother him here. The Elf sits down and begins 
                to chant. Small flickers of eldritch energy dance across the dark 
                elf's body as he continues to meditate. A short while later the 
                Dark elf opens his eyes and stands. He casts a shielding spell 
                to protect his newly reacquired flesh*</p>
              <p>Olot Dos to the pyramid's undead. They were most fortunate to 
                catch me unprepared for them. Attacking from behind seems too 
                calculated for mindless dead. Mayhaps they are not as dumb as 
                they would seem. And their uncanny loyalty and defense to one 
                another seems to indicate intelligence as well. I shall study 
                these undead further. For now I swear by mighty Innoruuk the prince 
                of hate, I shall own those undead one night. Then they shall pay 
                for their arrogance! Attacking me, LIFEBANE THE SERVANT OF INNORUUK! 
                They shall regret this rash action.</p>

              <p>I must retrieve the things from my old flesh... must make haste 
                before some fiend loots my possessions. I am still weak, how to 
                fix that.. hmmm.</p>
              <p>*Lifebane notes a fire beetle wandering nearby and a wide smirk 
                crosses his face.... he begins casting*</p>
              <p>Ahh... little one, thou shall do!</p>
              <p>*Through his necromantic incantation, Lifebane increases his 
                own strength as he saps the strength of the beetle. The beast 
                quickly falls under Lifebane's magical onslaught*</p>
              <p>Ahh... I fell better. Now.. to find my old flesh....</p>
              <p>*Lifebane sits for moment and casts another necromantic incantation, 
                he feels for the lingering remains of his essence and instantly 
                knows where he can LOCATE his corpse. Lifebane runs in that direction 
                and shortly comes upon the mangled remains of his former self.*</p>
              <p>Hmm... a splendid death at least. Nothing like dismemberment 
                and decapitation.</p>
              <p>*Lifebane retrieves his things and quickly equips them*</p>
              <p>Well then, I am better prepared then before... now let me even 
                the scales some.</p>
              <p>*Lifebane digs through his pouch and finds only 2 bone chips.*</p>
              <p>Hmmm... not a good sign. I shall have to begin to hunt for more 
                bone chips. Perhaps those blasted Pyramid skeletons would like 
                to donate some. Hmmm....</p>
              <p>*Lifebane grabs on of the bone chips and quickly buries it into 
                the ground with one finger. He then begins to chant and is surrounded 
                by an eerie glow... the glow fades.... then all is silent... a 
                moment later a clawed skeletal hand emerges from the ground followed 
                by the rest of the skeletal body.. the skeleton lets out a raspy 
                whisper &quot;yes master&quot;. Lifebane smiles at this and hands 
                the skeleton an axe to wield*</p>
              <p>Now I think I shall pay that skeleton at the pyramid another 
                now.... Lifebane runs off towards the pyramid with his skeleton 
                slave following closely behind....</p>

                <p>*Lifebane the Dark elf Necromancer crouches over a decaying 
                  corpse, retrieving an organ vital to his arts. He hears a noise 
                  and turns to see a young Dark elf entering into his quarters. 
                  Lifebane eyes the young one and realizes who this must be... 
                  the child of Ixzathul, the one that wishes to study necromancy.*</p>
                <p>Ahh... come closer young one. Sit, pay no mind to the bones 
                  scattered about. What is this I hear, you aspire to become a 
                  necromancer when you grow older? Well then, you are wiser then 
                  your years little one, for therein lies the true power. Necromancy 
                  alone has control over that which all others fear.... Death. 
                  No other can bring back the dead to serve the living. No other 
                  can steal the vital life forces of another to better yourself 
                  with. Nay young one, Tis a wise decision you make. Relax, let 
                  me tell you of the wonders of necromancy...</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>The necromancer specializes in hurting others to heal themselves. 
                    They also specialize in the summoning of the dead to serve 
                    their purposes. Eventually they develop powers beyond the 
                    scope of this, but that is to be learned much later in life... 
                    for now these two concepts are sufficient to describe the 
                    Necromancers life.</li>
                  <li>You will be despised by many, merchants will rarely deal 
                    with our kind, and even then they will tend to abuse the Necromancer 
                    with outrageous rates. But better expensive wares then none 
                    I suppose. It is important to note that many will attack our 
                    kind on sight. Beware these fools, for in their ignorance 
                    they condemn themselves. As your power grows, return and teach 
                    these fools the error in their ways! And you have chosen a 
                    hard path indeed for Dark elves are not welcome in most civilized 
                    areas, yet alone a dark elf necromancer! Beware!</li>
                  <li>Necromancers are dark, scheming beings who spend all their 
                    time practicing their arts. It is said that most aspire to 
                    cheat the inevitable death through their magic. Perhaps this 
                    is true. But this road is a long road that is full of death, 
                    decay, disease, and suffering. Revel in this, fear it not 
                    for it will be yours to control. Death is the Necromancers 
                    friend, disease a tool, decay... ahhh.. decay. A beautiful 
                    thing. So much so that the great god Innoruuk, bringer of 
                    plagues blesses all who serve him. Serve the Plague bringer 
                    and revel in the death and destruction. Fear not the worship 
                    of other gods since all the evil gods are allied. The plague 
                    bringer is the natural choice for our trade as is believed 
                    by many a necromancer.</li>
                  <li>Enjoy the suffering you inflict on others, gain power, amass 
                    dark magics... summon the dead to pummel your enemies. All 
                    the while, just stand back and enjoy the suffering. Of course 
                    you can feel free to add to their discomfort by draining their 
                    life as they fight your undead minions. Ahhh... such is the 
                    life of the necromancer.... Pain, Death, Decay, Disease, Famine... 
                    these are to you what sunlight, wine, laughter, and love are 
                    to the more frail beings in the land. Let them fear you! Ha! 
                    It is good they do, for at the drop of a gold coin, you would 
                    suck their soul away just to hear their scream of agony. Blood 
                    as Ice... never forget... you are hunted and hunter.. remember 
                    this and you will do well. *Lifebane stops and notices the 
                    frightened look in the young dark elf's eyes.*</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Hmm.. Perhaps you have changed your mind little one? Do not 
                  be frightened. The choice is yours...become one of the weak 
                  hearted or one of the strong. Tis your choice.. no harm will 
                  come to you if you change your mind... Go now... think on this 
                  little one.</p>
                <p>*The dark elf child runs out of the quarters. Lifebane cracks 
                  an evil smile...*</p>
                <p>He will return. I have seen it in the entrails of the halfling, 
                  that one will return. And one day, he will be a mighty Necromancer.</p>

            <blockquote> 
              <p>Somewhere in the depths of Neriak is a place where the wails 
                and shrieks of the tormented echo through the vaulting caverns 
                of our deep city. Here is a place where all the stone has been 
                stained in blood, and where the suffering of the pathetic and 
                helpless saturates the air, intoxicating. This place is the house 
                of the Shadowknights of Neriak, where they work side by side with 
                Neriak's Necromancers, the others who share our passion for death 
                and for pain. Why we come to this place to learn the arts of violence 
                is different for each Tier'dal who sets foot in the bloodied chambers. 
                Some, to bring suffering upon the light races who seek to stifle 
                our glory. Others, to follow the path of their ancestors, and 
                to serve Innoruuk faithfully, bringing death as their fathers 
                before them once did. And others, like myself, simply because 
                they delight in the torment of others, and seek to destroy every 
                living thing upon the face of Norrath. . .life is indeed a sickening 
                thing.</p>
              <p>Shadowknights share the arcane knowledge of our Necromancer brethren 
                to bring a greater efficiency to their dispensation of death. 
                We study side by side with them, but preferring the feeling of 
                blood upon our flesh, we seek first to learn how to bring our 
                victims to their knees through perfection of the use of implements 
                of pain. We are not content to kill with spells from afar, we 
                prefer the frenzy and carnage of the battlefield. We wish to feel 
                the squelch of spilled entrails beneath our feet, we wish to look 
                into the eyes of our victims as we send them to oblivion, to savor 
                the fear and rage that lie within at the moment of death. We use 
                our arcane knowledge to enrage our victims, and to steal their 
                life forces, so that we may better subdue them by the sword, or 
                to call up slaves from beyond the graves to fight by our side, 
                and die at our bidding.</p>
              <p>Regardless of the reason why we have chosen our path, all Shadowknights 
                share a common bond, of violence, and devotion to the Shadow Gods, 
                to further Innoruuk's glorious plans for Norrath. We all share 
                in our hate of the pale filth that lives upon the surface, content 
                in their false gods, and false peace. As Shadowknights, we all 
                seek the destruction of this pestilence, to cleanse it from the 
                face of Norrath, even if we are ourselves destroyed in the process. 
                We render all unto Innoruuk, our swords and our lives, and do 
                his bidding even if it means certain death. More often, the rivvil 
                do find that Innoruuk's bidding means their death, and the death 
                of their children, and not our own. The day shall come when they 
                cower before us, faces in the bloodied dirt begging for mercy, 
                and mercy they shall not have, only oblivion.</p>
              <p> <strong>How to role play a Dark Elf Shadowknight:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>Although each Shadowknight has their own reason for following 
                  their chosen path, they all share a common hatred for the light 
                  races of Norrath, and would do most anything to harm them, especially 
                  the followers of the false Gods of Light.</li>
                <li>Shadowknights frequently choose their path due to a fanatic 
                  devotion to the teachings of the Shadow Gods, and are thus vicious 
                  and cruel by nature, and delight in the suffering of others. 
                  They need no reason to kill, rather, they are usually compelled 
                  to do so.</li>
                <li>Shadowknights are primarily a melee class, their arcane powers 
                  being used for a tool to help support their melee abilities, 
                  not as their main offensive. They can be very helpful if wisely 
                  administered, but the Shadowknight must always remember that 
                  their primary strength is in their swords and in their hate.</li>
                <li>Shadowknights have the ability to call upon undead slaves 
                  to aid them in melee, but they must remember to use these slaves 
                  wisely. They will always be much weaker than the Shadowknight, 
                  and if sent in alone, will nearly always be killed. However, 
                  they do provide quite the perfect sacrificial lamb...</li>
                <li>Shadowknights are granted a power that brings grievous pain 
                  and the most intense suffering to their enemies, but they may 
                  only use this harm touch once per day. They must learn to use 
                  it wisely, and only in cases where death is imminent. It is 
                  foolish to rely upon it for offensive power, for it will frequently 
                  be resisted by creatures with a much greater power than the 
                  Shadowknight.</li>

              <p><strong>Word of Wisdom from a Tier'dall Shadowknight of the 40th 
                Season</strong></p>
              <p>Vendui jal.</p>
              <p>Usstan need dos jal help in the matter. It is of the role of 
                Shadowknight and what usstan have done recently to switch from 
                ussta solo days to become more efficient in a group. Usstan will 
                post some things that usstan have done to improve ussta role as 
                a shadowknight and would like to see what others think.</p>
              <p>First, usstan will describe what usstan see as the role of a 
                Shadowknight.</p>
              <ol>
                <li> Shadowknights are naut main damage dealers, Shadowknights 
                  roles in a group are: Taunt beasties off of casters, monks, 
                  and rogues, and also off of warriors when they are taking a 
                  major beating.</li>
                <li>Shadowknights support with magic, casting darkness when nau 
                  one else can, debuffing when nau necros are present, Using Harm 
                  Touch efficiently against strong, epic type mobs.</li>
                <li>And last, Shadowknights are pullers. This role is filled first 
                  by either a shadowknight or a monk, unless there is a zhuanth 
                  member that could pull more efficiently due to age.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Ok, these are things usstan have done to transition from soloist 
                to team contributor.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Put down the high damage, slow weapon for a decent damage, 
                  faster weapon. Ala Dark Reaver to Nathsar's Greatsword. This 
                  aids in taunt usstan believe.</li>
                <li>Gather more items that increase ussta Intelligence. Usstan 
                  have noticed that with high enough intelligence, usstan can 
                  cast lifetaps jal day, making the healers job esier and getting 
                  in another attack, thus taunting again.</li>
                <li>Watch the healers and casters lifebar. Usstan phlith seeing 
                  casters and healers getting bonked cause usually that spells 
                  disater. Nau pun intended.</li>
                <li>Realize that party makeup determines what dos can handle. 
                  Having 6 members in dosst party isn't as important as which 
                  six members dos have. Very important when pulling and trying 
                  to decide if the pull will be worthwhile.</li>
              </ol>
