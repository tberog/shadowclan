            <h3><a NAME="description"></a>Description:</h3>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Ogres are extremely large, strong and simple-minded creatures, 
                who are constantly looking for ways to fill their big hairy bellies. 
                Since they are usually the largest creatures around, they tend 
                to assume that &quot;bigger is better&quot; and tease or bully 
                those smaller than themselves. Their home city of Oggok is a series 
                of caves carved out of the living rock and is full of simple stone 
                structures. Most Ogres are easily amused, easily fooled, easily 
                frustrated and quick-tempered (especially if they are hungry). 
                Ogre society basically revolves around proving who is bigger and/or 
                stronger and Ogres often get into fights over the smallest things. 
                Ogres don't like to actually think to solve their problems. It 
                is much simpler (and more fun) to smash whatever (or whoever) 
                is causing the problem. Problem not solved? Add one more Ogre 
                to try to smash the problem (repeat until the problem is solved 
                or you run out of Ogres). This constant fighting and the fact 
                that most Ogre games are amazingly destructive and violent are 
                two causes of the Ogre race's devastating strength and combat 
                skills. Once enraged an Ogre can think of NOTHING other than crushing 
                the source of his or her frustration. Do NOT get in the way of 
                an angry Ogre&#8230;</p>
              <p>Ogres do most of their thinking (when they do think) on the subject 
                of FOOD and DRINK (and in the case of Shadowknights, planning 
                cruel new tortures for their victims). Generally when Ogres run 
                out of things to eat in and around Oggok, they will raid the settlements 
                of the smaller races, destroying the buildings, eating the livestock 
                and quite often eating the farmers who raised the livestock. With 
                their bellies full, the Ogres happily travel back to Oggok singing 
                songs and bragging about who did the most damage, who was the 
                most cruel, who ate the most food, and who drank the most! Unfortunately, 
                most other races don't seem to appreciate this type of behavior, 
                so Ogres are quite unpopular with most other races. Also contributing 
                to their lack of popularity is the fact that Ogres don't seem 
                to care too much for personal hygiene. And what do the Ogres think 
                about this?</p>

              <p>Background: We are mystic warriors, devoted to our gods and Soonag 
                our master to let blood and bring glory to the Greenbloods. We 
                view Cragneks with disdain, grudgingly maintaining a low profile 
                until we grow into our powers. At that point we let our clear 
                superiority shine through.Grevak, Soonag's right hand man we treat 
                as our master as well. Glory is gained through their eyes.</p>
              <p>Characteristics: Bloodletting, torture, and death are our stock 
                in trade. We toy with mortally wounded enemies and take great 
                pleasure in the pain of others. We value weapons over armor hoping 
                to inflict as opposed to receive. Glory and recognition is attained 
                through helping our brother Greenbloods by improving their weapons 
                and ability to hurt, maim and kill. We view our own injuries as 
                an opportunity to suck the life force out of our enemies. We quest 
                to achieve a state of pure evil. Shadowknights make great leaders 
                on the battlefield since they are a little (very little) more 
                intelligent than the warriors.</p>
              <p>Suggested RP devices: Possible emotes for casting include:</p>

            <blockquote> 
              <p>Most Ogre shamans are slightly smaller and slightly smarter than 
                their warrior and shadow knight brothers. Despite being slightly 
                smaller, they are still a powerful force to contend with because 
                of their magic (&quot;mojo&quot;) use. As children Ogres who become 
                shamans are picked on by their larger brethren for being smaller 
                and smarter than most. So, they tend to be a bit solitary and 
                bad tempered. However, as they grow older they often form close 
                bonds with other Ogres and Trolls who appreciate their mojo abilities. 
                Some have even been known to befriend dark elves, if only because 
                they don't taste good and are fun to tease.</p>
              <p>Ogre Shamans are often seen slightly behind the battle lines 
                muttering mojo words and making sparkly lights to smite their 
                foes and strengthen their kin and allies. Being Ogres, they still 
                occasionally go berserk, forget to use their mojo, and run headlong 
                into battle at the side of the warriors.</p>
              <p>Because of their faith and the strength of their god the mighty 
                Cazic-Thule, Ogre Shamans can at times be almost as effective 
                in melee as their larger kin. But when the berserker rage is over, 
                they have to pray to regain their strength. The strong religious 
                faith shamans possess also makes these Ogres even more superstitious 
                than most, and is responsible for the many odd rituals which they 
                tend to keep secret from the other Ogres.</p>
              <p>As with the religious types of many races Ogre Shamans are fond 
                of drinkee and are well known as the best brewers among the dark 
                races.</p>
              <p>While they enjoy the hedbutt game, Ogre Shamans prefer the slightly 
                more cerebral sport of dwarf tossing. It's an exciting sport, 
                although at times the contestants get a bit too excited and eat 
                the dwarves. At this point, whoever eats the most dwarves is declared 
                the winner.</p>

              <li>Threaten to use any dwarf you see in a game of dwarf tossing</li>
              <li>Be bad tempered</li>
              <li>Be superstitious</li>
              <li>Make fun of your less intelligent kin as they will surely mock 
                your small size, (Remember you are still an Ogre and not too bright 
                yourself though!)</li>

            <h3><a NAME="warrior"></a>Warrior:</h3>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Ogre Warriors are the biggest of the big, the baddest of the 
                bad, and the strongest of the strong. Unfortunately, they're also 
                the dumbest of the dumb. It is rare to find an Ogre Warrior that 
                doesn't need help to count higher than the number of fingers on 
                one battle scarred hand. But, most Ogre Warriors just don't care 
                about all that thinking stuff. As long as there is food in their 
                stomachs and things to crush beneath their huge smelly feet they 
                are content. Ogre Warriors live for the opportunity to prove their 
                physical superiority to all others and will usually charge into 
                battle without any type of a plan other than to physically overwhelm 
                their opponent.</p>
              <p>Because of their size and strength Ogre Warriors generally feel 
                that they have no need to use magic spells (besides those scrolls 
                are too tough to read, anyway.. stupid words). However, they don't 
                mind being healed, and actually like being magically strengthened 
                (even if they are not really sure what is going on, magic makes 
                pretty lights). Ogre Warriors will use magic weapons and armor, 
                if they feel it helps them smash things better.</p>
              <p>Ogre Warriors crave destruction almost as much as they crave 
                food. This works itself out nicely because Ogre Warriors generally 
                try to eat whatever (or whoever) they destroy. Special delicacies 
                for an Ogre Warrior include: Dwarf heads, mixed with whole Gnome's 
                by the handful (Mmmmmm). Elves tend to be a bit too spicy (especially 
                dark elves) and trolls can cause a bad case of indigestion. But, 
                a nice plump halfling or human bar-b-qued on the grill is a special 
                treat no Ogre would pass up. Unfortunately, most Ogres don't eat 
                that well all the time, and so they have to satisfy their insatiable 
                hunger with whatever animals they can kill (and any other object 
                that looks tasty, for example: colorful rocks). Additionally, 
                some Ogre Warriors have been known to supplement their diet with 
                massive amounts of alcohol.</p>
              <p>During their youth, all Ogres (male and female) are &quot;groomed&quot; 
                to become warriors. Young Ogres are taught &quot;da hedbut game&quot; 
                as a way to build community, establish a social structure, and 
                prove their strength (without killing each other). This practice 
                is rumored by some to be one of many probable causes of the Ogre 
                race's generally limited intelligence. Ogre Warriors continue 
                to practice &quot;da hedbut game&quot; through adulthood just 
                for fun. Young Ogres that are exceptionally smart (poor things) 
                or exceptionally evil (blessed by the Shadow god) tend not to 
                stay long in the warrior class. These Ogres eventually become 
                Shamans or Shadow Knights. But, as many a smushed opponent has 
                learned, having a true Ogre Warrior on your side in a fight can 
                often mean the difference between being victorious and being dinner!</p>
