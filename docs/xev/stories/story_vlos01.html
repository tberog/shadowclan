            <p>I was talking with another of my kind one day when he told me about 
              a group of Ogres and Trolls which were called the shadow clan. I 
              was amazed to hear that other dark elves lived with them. I asked 
              myself, what possible reason would dark elves be living with Ogres 
              and Trolls? No matter how many reasons I kept coming up with, the 
              possibilities of making a lot of gold kept creeping into my mind.. 
              Yes Profit! Ogres and Trolls killing and slaughtering humans, just 
              think of the riches that would be left behind by these mindless 
              brutes. After they killed every last human on the battlefield there 
              would be jewels, money pouchs, weapons of all kinds scattered all 
              over. I could be rich! I traveled for many days looking for this 
              group called the shadow clan. Thinking such a mass mob like them 
              would be easy to find, seeing how big they all were, I was unable 
              to find any sign of them anywhere. On the 10th day just before the 
              sun hit the horizon they appeared over the horizon. There must have 
              been at least 30 of them. I didn't know what to do! I didn't dare 
              reach for my bow with such a large group approaching me. </p>
            <p>Unexpectingly the first one I noticed approaching me was not a 
              Troll or an Ogre as I would have. It was a dark elf like myself, 
              he walked very slowly towards me as a strange deep laughter came 
              from behind him. I flexed my wrist slowly to release a hidden dagger, 
              slowly it slid down my sleeve into my hand. The Dark elf, wearing 
              red robes, stood before me quitely watching to see how I would react. 
              In common tongue he turned and said only three words &quot;He will 
              do&quot;, those few words made me shiver like a cold gust of polar 
              wind.</p>
            <p>I thought I was a goner, I figured if I must die I'm going out 
              fighting. The first to step in sight was a huge Troll, he reached 
              down and grabbed my arm. Lifting me with ease off my feet he pulled 
              me closer towards his face, with my dagger in hand I buried it deep 
              within the left eye of the Troll. The Troll howled in pain and dropped 
              to one knee. He didn't release his grip on my arm even slightly. 
              I thought I was going to be tortured or eaten by him, but no he 
              started to laugh a deep bellowing laugh. I stared in amazement towards 
              the dark elf that only smirked at me. The Troll reached for the 
              dagger with his other hand and pulled the dagger out of his eye. 
              I stared in disbelief as his eye slowly started to heal right before 
              my eyes.</p>
            <p>To this very day I am not sure what the dark elf wanted of me, 
              but my life was spared and I have been living with the shadow clan 
              ever since. The riches are here but getting them is not as easy 
              as I first . Trolls and Ogres are as greedy as me (smiles). I do 
              not trust or care about the Trolls or Ogres in the least but I have 
              grown to be somewhat friends with an odd one-eyed Troll who's eye 
              never really healed right.</p>
