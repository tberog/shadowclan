            <p>As a cleric of Innoruuk, many people, dark or light, have many 
              expectations of me. Many seek me out, in hopes of a quick heal, 
              or perhaps a blessing from Innoruuk. What they fail to remember, 
              however, is that I am evil, full of hatred and that I cater to none 
              of them...Unless it benefits myself, of course. So there I was, 
              a young cleric (contrary to terms), practicing my skills on various 
              dark elves I passed. Once my skills were learned to a certain degree, 
              I kept them to myself until needed. Unfortunately I seemed to have 
              contracted a few followers who knew of my skills along the way. 
              I'm thinking that I need to rid myself of these followers, as they 
              are of no benefit to my journey. There I stood, on the bridge of 
              Nektulos Forest, having a rather intense conversation with one of 
              the guards about the 2 humans he had recently slain who were trying 
              to cross his bridge. His story was rather amusing, and therefore 
              had my full attention as a young lad approached me, nearly falling 
              at my feet. I take note of this, and wonder why people are always 
              crawling on the ground around me. Are they wanting healed perhaps? 
              Hmmm. I step over him and continue talking with the guard. &quot;poisoned&quot; 
              was all the lad could say. So I look down upon him, hold out my 
              hand and ask, &quot;got a gold piece?&quot; He promised a gold piece 
              when he was able to move again, so I cured his poisoning and received 
              my payment then continued with my conversation with the guard. &quot;could 
              you please heal me?&quot; he asks. &quot;Got a gold piece?&quot; 
              was my reply. And so he hands me another gold piece. &quot;Sit...and 
              you will be healed, child&quot; Needless to say, he was not pleased 
              with this &quot;cleric&quot; and so told me so. He told me of how 
              I'm the meanest person he has met yet. I bowed and thanked him. 
              Just as soon as I thought I was all alone again in my travels, this 
              young lad approaches me again, this time much more experienced than 
              the last time I saw him. I gave him the blessings of Innoruuk this 
              time, and a gift to go with it. No longer is he an enemy, and also 
              no longer is he a follower. He is now my equal, and has learned 
              well.</p>
