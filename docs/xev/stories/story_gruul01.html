            <p>The hordling</p>
            <p>Gruul moved quietly, at least for an ogre, toward the pit. He was 
              fascinated by the whelps, screams and howls eminating from the opening. 
              Four other ogres, vying for the two hordling positions, lumbered 
              along with him. Gruul could see the bloodlust and excitement in 
              their eyes. When they neared the edge, Gruul leaned over and looked 
              down on the bloodletting. He saw 3 dead ogres and two mammoth brutes 
              still battling. He was surprised to see his brother still living. 
              Nug'tug, the other ogre was the best the village had to offer and 
              had a longstanding feud with Gruul's older brother Gruum. Gruul's 
              hopes began to rise seeing Nug'tug trip over one of the dead ogre's 
              outstretched hands but as Gruum stepped in to finish his opponent, 
              Gruul cringed. He recognized the feint and braced himself as Nug'tug 
              finished his brother off with a savage slash to the neck. Nug'tug 
              jerked the rusty blade out of the vertebrae and bellowed a victory 
              cry to the pair of black booted ogres watching from the rim of the 
              pit. They grinned triumphantly and motioned him out. &quot;Yu du 
              gud slasha Nug,&quot; they laughed. &quot;Yu juss git un mur an 
              we pud yu in de horde.&quot; Tired and spent, Nug'tug flopped down 
              on a mat of hay, content to watch the last battle, then kill his 
              opponent for the Hordling position. The blakbuuts had come to their 
              village to recruit 2 hordlings for the Shadowclan. Two more warriors 
              for the collection of races that had banded together to fight against 
              the forces of good that to pushed deeper each day into the ogre, 
              troll and dark elf lands. The blakbuuts motioned the remaining 5 
              ogres into the pit. Gruul bent over his older brother's body and 
              wiped a line of blood from the top of his head to his chin, following 
              the ritual his shaman master had taught him. Gruul carefully thought 
              back over his training, focusing the hate, bloodlust and love of 
              torture into a force that could be channeled with the help of his 
              god. Gruul was a shadowknight, a holy warrior bestowed with gifts 
              from birth and helped along by the village shaman. No one knew of 
              this ability but after today he understood his secret would be out. 
              The four other ogres prepared for battle, ignoring Gruul as he was 
              a good 200 pounds lighter and a foot shorter. He also was relatively 
              clumsy with his scimitar. The blakbuuts tossed a lit torch into 
              the pit and signaled the start of the last battle. Two of the ogres 
              immediately banded together and went to work on the largest ogre 
              in the pit. Gruul focused on his learning and effortlessly weaved 
              through the flying blades and clubs to dish out wounds that were 
              more annoying tremendous blow to the head, then, frustrated by being 
              unable to get a clean hit on Gruul, went after the other lone ogre. 
              They finished him off as well, but not before he slipped under their 
              guard and stuck his axe a foot deep into the side of one of them. 
              Gruul, in a state of meditation and focused on his god, could see 
              the lifeforce leaking out of the ogre. He stepped closer and with 
              an open hand, sucked the remaining essence from the ogre's body. 
              The combatant collapsed at the feet of its uncomprehending ally. 
              By the time its partner looked away Gruul had slashed it across 
              the forearm, severing tendons and ligaments causing it to drop its 
              weapon. The ogre looked down at the club and then back up to the 
              scimitar jutting out from its belly. Gruul jerked it left then up, 
              allowing the artery to spurt blood and gore on his chest and face. 
              He lifted his foot, placed it next to the entry wound, and pushed 
              the ogre's body off his blade. A dark and confused look passed over 
              the blakbuuts' faces and they huddled in discussion. An hour and 
              two more dead ogres later, they were on the road to the clan encampment, 
              two brand new hordlings in tow, Nug'tug and Gruul. The blakbuuts 
              walked next to Nug'tug, keeping a good distance between them and 
              Gruul. The faceless one had infused his student with great understanding 
              of his powers and instilled a profound hatred toward the simple 
              warriors. They nervously continued on, all but Nug'tug casting strained 
              glances back at the future Shadowknight.</p>
