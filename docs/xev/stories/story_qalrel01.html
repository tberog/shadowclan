          <td valign="top"><h3>The Ghuvor</h3>
            <p>A long time ago in Cabilis, a young eggling was hatched. She was 
              named Qalrel, by her mother, Nallena Zhatal. As a child, she was 
              told stories of her father, though she never really knew him. Such 
              things were said as that he was a great warrior, others stated that 
              he was a cowardly thief, and some stated he was long dead. Qalrel 
              did not know what to make of these tales, and her mother would not 
              utter a word about Qalrel's father... until one day.<br>
              &quot;Mother, Cazic-Thule may ssmile today, for our enemies will 
              now only know fear! I hass been accepted under the tutilage of the 
              warriorss!&quot;</p>
            <p>Her mother just looked at her for a long time, until at last, a 
              smile came, accompanied by a tear.</p>
            <p>&quot;Child, tssu are tssur father's daughter.&quot;</p>
            <p>Then and there, time seemed to stand still.</p>
            <p>&quot;Tssu sspoke of father... perhapss thiss meanss tssu will 
              tell more?&quot;</p>
            <p>Nallena Zhatal, a woman of pride, was now teary eyed and trembling. 
              A few moments later, her hands steadied, and she spoke.</p>
            <p>&quot;Tssur father... hiss name wass Oerngl. He wass a proud warrior. 
              He wanted tssu to have thiss.&quot;</p>
            <p>She stood up and took out a small pouch. This was an article that 
              Qalrel had seen her mother with often, and always she clasped it 
              tightly, and held it to her heart. She opened the small pouch, and 
              took out a dull dark grey thing.<br>
              &quot;Thiss wass what he left uss when he wass ssummoned to war.&quot;</p>
            <p>She flipped it over and upon a smoothened surface, there was an 
              insignia in a crystalline material.</p>
            <p>&quot;He never told me what it wass, or what it wass for, or even 
              what it ssayss. But nonetheless, when tssu took tssur place with 
              the warriorss, he wanted tssu to have it.&quot;</p>
            <p>Nallena handed the small artifact to her daughter. Qalrel looked 
              deep into it, every facet, every little indentation, and especially 
              the detail. She wanted to destroy it, for she felt a burning rage 
              of mistrust, but at the same time wished to cherish it, for it was 
              as her father had wished. She held it in her hand, then enveloped 
              it in her claws, and clenched her fists.</p>
            <p>&quot;Why wass I not told earlier? Why did tssu wait until now?&quot;</p>
            <p>Nallena frowned, and with sad eyes, looked upon her daughter.</p>
            <p>&quot;Freedom of choice, what if we told tssu tssu would be a warrior, 
              wouldn't tssu want ssome ssay in the matter? It wass what tssur 
              father wanted, and alsso, becausse now it can be ssecure, that tssu 
              are in alliance with the Legionnairess of Cabiliss.&quot;</p>
            <p>Qalrel looked down at the insignia, and then at her mother, then 
              back to the insignia. She clasped it tightly, and went to the Legionnaire 
              trainers for her first assignment, without another word to her mother 
              since that night. Still, she wonders if she made the right choice, 
              leaving without a single word.</p>
