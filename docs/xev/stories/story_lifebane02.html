          <td valign="top"> <h3>The Cycle of Death and Life</h3>
            <p>*A green haze drifts near the great maw on a mountainside, a place 
              known as Neriak the evil home of the Dark elves of Norrath The green 
              haze drifts near the entrance and slows to a stop near a large fallen 
              tree. The silence of the night is broken as a low growl is heard 
              from the green haze, and a being begins to take form.... a dark 
              elf slowly becomes more and more solid as the green haze disappears, 
              drawn back within the dark elf's flesh*</p>
            <p>Arrrgh... the pains of transitioning back into the living.... perhaps 
              being non-corporeal does have some benefits. </p>
            <p>*The dark elf looks around the nearby mountainside, admiring the 
              entrance to his native home of Neriak, feeling safe now that he 
              is once again under the protection of the Neriak Guards, the beasts 
              shall not bother him here. The Elf sits down and begins to chant. 
              Small flickers of eldritch energy dance across the dark elf's body 
              as he continues to meditate. A short while later the Dark elf opens 
              his eyes and stands. He casts a shielding spell to protect his newly 
              reacquired flesh*</p>
            <p>Curses on the pyramid's undead. They were most fortunate to catch 
              ussa unprepared for them. Attacking from behind seems too calculated 
              for mindless undead. Mayhaps they are nau as dumb as they would 
              seem. And their uncanny loyalty and defense to one another seems 
              to indicate intelligence as well. Ussa shall study these undead 
              further. For now ussa swear by mighty Innoruuk the prince of hate, 
              ussa shall own those undead one night. Then they shall pay for their 
              arrogance! Attacking ussa, LIFEBANE THE SERVANT OF INNORUUK! They 
              shall regret this action.</p>
            <p>*Lifebane takes a quick look over himself and seems satisfied..... 
              he begins to RUN off towards the forest*</p>
            <p>Ussa must retrieve the things from ussa's old flesh... must make 
              haste before some fiend loots my possessions. Ussa am still weak, 
              how to fix that.. hmmm.</p>
            <p>*Lifebane notes a fire beetle wandering nearby and a wide smirk 
              crosses his face.... he begins casting*</p>
            <p>Ahh... little one, dos shall do!</p>
            <p>*Through his necromantic incantation, Lifebane increases his own 
              strength as he saps the strength of the beetle. The beast quickly 
              falls under Lifebane's magical onslaught*</p>
            <p>Ahh... ussa fell better. Now.. to find ussa old flesh....</p>
            <p>*Lifebane sits for moment and casts another necromantic incantation, 
              he feels for the lingering remains of his essence and instantly 
              knows where he can LOCATE his corpse. Lifebane runs in that direction 
              and shortly comes upon the mangled remains of his former self.*</p>
            <p>Hmm... a splendid death at least. Nothing like dismemberment and 
              decapitation.</p>
            <p>*Lifebane retrieves his things and quickly equips them*</p>
            <p>Well then, ussa am better prepared then before... now let ussa 
              even the scales some.</p>
            <p>*Lifebane digs through his pouch and finds only 2 bone chips.*</p>
            <p>Hmmm... nau a bwael sign. ussa shall have to begin to hunt for 
              more bone chips. Perhaps those blasted Pyramid skeletons would like 
              to donate some. Hmmm....</p>
            <p>*Lifebane grabs on of the bone chips and quickly buries it into 
              the ground with one finger. He then begins to chant and is surrounded 
              by an eerie glow... the glow fades.... then all is silent... a moment 
              later a clawed skeletal hand emerges from the ground followed by 
              the rest of the skeletal body.. the skeleton lets out a raspy whisper 
              &quot;yes master&quot;. Lifebane smiles at this and hands the skeleton 
              an axe to wield*</p>
            <p>Now ussa think ussa shall pay that skeleton at the pyramid another 
              visit....</p>
            <p>*Lifebane runs off towards the pyramid with his skeleton slave 
              following closely behind.... *</p>
            <p>Lifebane Lil'Valdruk<br>
              Elder Of Shadowclan</p>
