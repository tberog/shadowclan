            <p>Chug being born a few days earlier had the knowledge of the area 
              little bit before Ratgag's(Thag) arrival but only that of Oggok 
              and Fearrot. They spent the morning searching the forest of Fearrot 
              for Lizard Broodlings and Decaying Corpses. Many times voices could 
              be heard throughout the forest, &quot;Chug wer ib yu?&quot; &quot;Help 
              Ratgag! dem chasing me!&quot;</p>
            <p>Me nub see yu, it tu dark!&quot;. The woods would never be the 
              same again!</p>
            <p>After a while the two of them double teaming these smaller creatures 
              were looking for more of a challenge. They started thinking that 
              they could clomp anything so they headed for the nearest Lizardman 
              Camp. The plan was to surround the Lizard Mistic and clomp him first 
              and then worry about the other two later. Well Chug layed dead next 
              to the Mistics feet while Ratgag ran around after the mistic made 
              him blind and accidently ran right into the water and drowned.</p>
            <p>After about 10 minutes of sneaking up and getting there things 
              back the two decided to see what was on the other side of the bridge. 
              Walking accross the bridge they start seeing some large temple like 
              buildings and then they notice one lizard warrior standing on top 
              of one of them. Of course being the strong (head strong) Ogres that 
              they are they attack it. Well after they finally get their things 
              back from their corpses they decide to take the rest of the day 
              off and take up fishing.</p>
            <p>Sitting on the bridge with poles in hand the two of them spent 
              the day catching many things. Heres some of the things they caught...Fish, 
              Fish Scales, Daggers and shoes. In between spilling their beers 
              and falling off the bridge, actually I think Ratgag pushed me, they 
              talked about the day that they had and both had smiles on their 
              face.</p>
