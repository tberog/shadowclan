            *Twas a foul eve, no stars to be seen, all having been blotted out 
            by the many storm clouds which now release this deluge which assaults 
            the forest. Lifebane the necromancer, with the night's rains pouring 
            down his body, wondered the forests on one of his frequent &quot;harvests&quot; 
            of bone chips.*
<p>I will never understand the weak humans dislike of the rains my 
              undead friend. Tis quite refreshing to know that mother darkness 
              has an ally in battling the light. Clouds are a god send, thank 
              you mighty Innoruuk, may many a creature perish and decay this eve. 
              I have checked the entrails of the dead as taught by my lord, and 
              I have seen what I must do to gain my ever elusive next level of 
              mastery. But where to find a creature of light within our dark forests. 
              Any ideas my fleshless friend?</p>
            <p>*The undead stares blankly back at his master*</p>
            <p>Not now you say? Alright then, I shall ask you later. Either way, 
              tis a daunting task, I must continue on with my Harvest of bone... 
              Bertoxxulous will show me the way I am certain of it.</p>
            <p>*Lifebane wanders the countryside, all the while conversing with 
              his ever silent undead companion. The pair crush many a decaying 
              skeleton in the area and gather a few handfulls of bone chips.*</p>
            <p>Tis been a profitable eve for us. Is that not right friend?</p>
            <p>*no answer from the undead*</p>
            <p>I agree, many bone, a good harvest yet no sign of the being of 
              light. Very well then, I have considered your suggestion and we 
              shall do as you ask. We shall postbone the bone harvest and seaarch 
              for this being of light.</p>
            <p>*again, no reply from the undead slave*</p>
            <p>Ahhh... yes of course my decomposing friend, we shall use you as 
              bait. Good idea. You may have been a pathetic Rivvil in your former 
              life, but now, you are truly great undead.</p>
            <p>*Lifebane finds a rather heavily travelled path in the deep forests. 
              An odd place for a well worn path, especially beng so far from the 
              city proper.*</p>
            <p>Very well, you are right. This is an excellent location. I wish 
              you to GUARD HERE. I shall hide atop that log there. If a being 
              of light comes, they will obviously attack you, then I shall assault 
              them with my powers. Together we shall have that little do-gooder 
              by the entrails in short time.</p>
            <p>*Lifebane goes into hiding atop the log and the undead slave just 
              stands on the path waiting. The silence of the night, up til now 
              broken only by the dull sound of the constant downpour, is greeted 
              by a new sound.... a sound like a swarm of bees. A moment later 
              a PIXIE darts in from the undergrowth and stabs the undead slave, 
              the undead rakes one clawed hand across the pixies hovering back, 
              damaging the little beings wings beyond repair. The Pixie gently 
              drops to the ground and continues to battle the undead... actually 
              gaining the upperhand despite his injuries. Lifebane cracks a wicked 
              grin from his hiding place and begins to cast his necromancy on 
              the unsuspecting beast... the pixie shall not long enjoy the advantage 
              in this combat*</p>
            <p>pathetic minion of light. Bertoxxulous the plague bringer warned 
              me of your intrusions. Did you think you caould travel these forests 
              unhindered? Thou shall perish little one, and your soul shall be 
              mine!</p>
            <p>*with that final statement, Lifebane finishes his casting and his 
              Lifespike incantation takes affect, the Pixie suddenly withers up 
              and apparently ages many years... a scream of agony escapes his 
              little lungs before the last of his life is sucked away... Lifebane, 
              however, seems to have a different affect... his face appears less 
              tired, his skin less worn, he stands a bit straighter then before.... 
              the Lifeforce of the Pixie having a definite rejuuvenating affect 
              on him. As the spells affects seem to reach their end, a raspy yet 
              commanding voice is heard:</p>
            <p>Innoruuk:<br>
              &quot;Good my servant, you progress well Lifebane. You have ended 
              the usefulness of that little spy of light... the minions of light 
              believe fast wings and a small target allows for safe passage through 
              these sacred groves... You have shown them otherwise. I am pleased... 
              I grant thee your next level of power... serve me well, decay to 
              all things Lifebane... we shall speak again&quot;</p>
            <p>*The last of Innoruuk's words echo off into the distance, a wicked 
              smile appears on Lifebane's face... as you wish master. As you wish. 
              Lifebane turns his attention back to the fallen pixie and approaches 
              the little corpse.*</p>
            <p>Good work my rotting companion, the lightling fell to our trap. 
              What is that you say friend? A magical bauble? On the little one? 
              Hmmm.</p>
            <p>*lifebane reaches down and digs through the small corpses possessions 
              and locates a slightly glowing tiny dagger.*</p>
            <p>Ahh... tis a Pixie stinger my friend, good only for annoying anything 
              larger then an ant. Good catch though, you have a good eye, hmm... 
              or rather a good eye socket for these things. Thank you for your 
              assist friend. May Innoruuk continue to guide us... shall we resume 
              our bine hunt? Good, good... you lead then.</p>
            <p>*The eerie pair wander off into the bowels of the night forest*</p>
            <p>Lifebane Lil'Valdruk<br>
              Elder Of Shadowclan</p>
