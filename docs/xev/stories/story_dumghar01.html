            <p>HOOWAH!!! Four young ogurs yelld as a warrior type walked up a 
              dirt path to a Finely Carved Skull shaped entrance to a cave .&#8221;Hims 
              heer Hims heer!!! Ids reely hims!!! Dumghar is comin home HOOWAH!!!&#8221; 
              more and more ogres filled out of this cave as if Rallos Zek himself 
              was coming. The sounds of deep horns blew through the ferrott notifying 
              everyone that someone was coming home&#8230; The hulking mass of 
              ogre wearing leather hides highlighted with chains and spikes walks 
              to a female dressed in bear furs and fine jewels speeks &#8220;UG 
              DAR moma how is yu?&#8221; then he tuns to his father and kneels 
              &#8220;Ug dar me lord me brot baks wat yu ordurd me tu git&#8221;. 
              The huge beast hands the larger mass of ogre a large sack of blood 
              dripping heads of 4 woodelf warriors. &#8220;Ahhh&#8221; the ogre 
              says &#8220;gud gud Dumghar yu dun us ogurs well bud da time has 
              com dat yu mus gu on an lerns da arts of a Shadowknight&#8221; Dumghar 
              looks up at his father and speaks &#8220;bud fader me neds tu stay 
              heer so we nub git bashd by dem clans ob lizzies an travulin pastis 
              dat try to keel us&#8221;. &#8220;NUB!!!&#8221; the large one speaks 
              &#8220;YU will gu to oggok an seek da leeder ob da greenbloods and 
              tell hims me Dugum Clobberclomp sends yas tu lern an gib hims dis&#8221; 
              he hands Dumghar a tattered note &#8220;Nub woree Dumghar der is 
              much yu nub kno boud yur life.Der was plans ob yur birf by Rallos 
              Zek himself an now hims calling yu tu du his mitee werk su yu mus

              cuz yu askd me tu&#8221; Dumghar stands and salutes his father. 
              Then the beast looks at his mother as a tear drops from his eye 
              as he hugs her, yu nub woree me will see yu wuns agin bud me mus 
              gu now su till den me lubs yas an stops cryin&#8221;. He turns and 
              walks away not looking back at the cheering as all he remembers 
              is the tears running down his mothers face...</p>
            <p>Three days later he ends up at the mighty stone gates of Oggok 
              and hails the guards. Two guards do some signals to the guards up 
              on top of the stone structure and hits a lever and the gates begin 
              to rise. &#8220;Wer yu guin der wuss?&#8221; the right guard says 
              &#8220;wer me is guin yu nub needin tu kno...an if yu tinks me a 
              wuss yus guts anuder ting comin!&#8221; as Dumghar speaks, then 
              stares the guard directly in his eyes causing a startled look in 
              the guards eyes .&#8221;BAH yus wach whu yusspeekin tu boy me wills 
              clomps yu gud ib yu speeks tu me like dat agin!!!&#8221;the guard 
              sternly speaks. &#8220;HAR&#8221; wer da Greenbloods Guild at? Dumghar 
              says. The guard points to the north west &#8220;ober der&#8221; 
              Dumghar nods and starts to walk towards the guild as the gates close. 
              Dumghar reaches the onyx stone doors of the guild with the insignia 
              of an Ivroy skull with green blood running from its eye sockets 
              and two large swords crisscrossing in the back ground. Dumghar begins 
              to open the door as a cold quick breeze rushing through him causeing 
              a short feeling of fear as he grabs the handle but shakes it off 
              and continues to enter the room. The room is dark and is wretched 
              the smell of death and decay. Skeletons wielding weapons of exquisite 
              make wander about as if they were being controlled by someone. &#8220;WUT 
              DU YU WANT!!&#8221; A deep voice speaks &#8220;WAT DU YU WANT ME 
              ASKS YAS??? SPEEKIE NOW OR DIE WID NO HONOR!!!&#8221; Dumghar pauses 
              a minute and reaches into his tattered shirt then kneels. &#8220;I 
              am Dumghar Clobberclomp son of Dugum Clobberclomp hims gib mes dis 
              note an sez gib tu da leedur ob dis gild&#8221; Four candles light 
              around a single throne made of polished granite and a gruesome looking 
              ogre in full steel plate signals to a skeleton as if he controlled 
              it to get the note. The skeleton cackles a hideous laughter as he 
              grabs the tattered note and hands it to this ogre in the throne. 
              &#8220;So yur da sun ob da grate Shadowknight Dugum Clobberclomp 
              eh?&#8221; the ogre speaks. &#8220;Yub Yub me is hims sun mi leege&#8221; 
              Dumghar says...&#8221;well why yu nub jus say su instead ob actin 
              like sum craknek cowerin on da floor, HAR git up yu big ogur yu&#8221;...&#8221;Me 
              names is Bogmash Skulllcraker an im da leeder ob dis guild&#8221; 
              the ogre sticks his hand out towards Dumghar &#8220;yus guts lots 
              tu lerns but furst me git yus dis fer yur training&#8221; the ogre 
              helps Dumghar to his feet and and brings him to a room down the 
              hall. &#8220;Dis is yur ruum an dis wer yu guna lern da dark mojo 
              ob da shadowknights of oggok&#8221; He opens the door and in the 
              room on a silver stand holds a brand new suit of bronze armor and 
              an axe. &#8220;Dis stuffies&#8230;.Dis stuffies is fer me?&#8221; 
              Dumghar asks &#8220;yub yub is stuffies fer yus and dat axe iz beree 
              speshul but den da son ob Rallos Zek wans nutin bud da besties stuffies 
              fer his first born&#8221;... Dumghar looks up in astonishment &#8220;yu
