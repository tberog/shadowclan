            <p>*settles herself comfortably on a moss covered stump in Nektulos 
              Forest* <br>
              Usstan has recently had a few waelin ones ask Usstan how usstan 
              became known as The Mama... those of dos wishing to hear the tale,find 
              dostself a refreshment or two and come sit here near ussa...</p>
            <p>*appears lost in thought for a moment and then begins...*</p>
            <p>It pains ussa greatly right here *pats her chest with an open palm* 
              to speak of Ussta parents...but to understand who usstan am... dos 
              must know what happened...</p>
            <p>Ussta mother was a renowned midwife.She showed great skill at her 
              trade.When it came time to bear their dalharen, all the nobility 
              requested ussta mother attend them.</p>
            <p>*smiles at those assembled*</p>
            <p>Usstan would lay wager that many of dost' parents and grandparents 
              were guided into this world by her hand....anyway....</p>
            <p>Usstan had just begun training with ussta mother when udos were 
              called to the House of a very well respected Lady who's time was 
              near.As always,when udos arrived to tend the Lady, ussta mother 
              sent ussa to do the menial chores...upon returning to the room with 
              the desired supplies usstan heard terrible screams.Now, usstan was 
              used to hearing women give birth... but this was different.Ussta 
              mother looked up from the Lady to ussa, there was a fear in her 
              solen usstan had never seen before.She told ussa,&quot;Leave this 
              place! Leave now! Run!&quot;.Usstan did as usstan was told,usstan 
              turned and fled,fled from the horror in ussta mothers solen.*pauses 
              a moment* That was the last time usstan ever saw ussta mother...Usstan 
              never found out the truth of what happened... tho there were many 
              rumours.The most prevelent rumour being; that the child was hidiously 
              deformed...and naut fully Teir'dal.</p>
            <p>Upon hearing of usstans mother's dissapearance usstans father returned 
              from battle to avenge her.He was a fearless warrior, but had always 
              been kind and gentle to his family.*shakes her head sadly*When he 
              returned this time he was different...empty and cold...and on a 
              mission.Usstan remembers him gathering his weapons and strapping 
              them all over himself until dos could barely see him for velves 
              and hammers...*absently touches two fingers to the middle of her 
              forehead* Usstan remember him giving each of udos dalharen a kiss...that 
              is the last time usstan ever saw ussta father...but usstan can tell 
              dos this...the House of those Nobles from which ussta mother never 
              returned, nau longer stands within the walls of Neriak...</p>
            <p>*takes a deep breath and resumes speaking*</p>
            <p>As dos has probably guessed... usstan was angry and full of hatred, 
              naut a bad thing for a teir'dal usstan will grant dos, but usstan 
              was naut using usstan emotion in a productive manner.Usstan decided 
              to follow in ussta father's footsteps.Usstan felt that as a warrior 
              usstan could do the most damage...Usstan had naut been outside the 
              sanctuary of Neriak much as a dalhar and was naut well equipt to 
              venture far... tho that didnt stop ussa from going out and smashing 
              anything that moved...and getting elgged alot usstaself in the process.One 
              moon after watching ussta pathetic attempts at elgging the beasts 
              in Nektulos, Prietess Raynin,who was also the dark Inquisitor for 
              a fearsome guild called &quot;Shadowclan&quot;*looks around and 
              grins*, took ussa under her wing.She took usstan back into Neriak 
              and fitted ussa with some of her old armour and gave usstan a better 
              weapon.Now usstan could elgg more beasts but still usstan found 
              nau satisfaction... nau peace...Raynin suggested that maybe a change 
              of scenery would help... she took ussa by the hand and led ussa 
              far from home.Usstan was awed by the daylight in The East Commonlands...and 
              shocked by all the sand between there and the swamp!She took usstan 
              into Oggok and bound ussa there, it was an uneasy feeling being 
              tied to someplace usstan had never been before but usstan was too 
              distaracted to give it much thought.Then Raynin led ussa acoss a 
              fallen pillar and showed usstan all the lizardmen that needed elgging!She 
              left usstan there.. but before she left...she explained to ussa 
              that usstan was going to need to find some abbils soon... that usstans 
              life was naut being spent wisely or productively being a loner.Usstan 
              did naut listen... usstan just went on elgging lizardmen. Usstan 
              became stronger each day... but still...peace did naut come to ussa...until...until 
              one moon... Usstan was resting on that fallen pillar,listening to 
              the frogs splashing in the water below while staring at the dumb 
              doll usstan had taken from the lizard mystic's stinking corpse...staring 
              at its lifeless solen... then usstan started to cry, and cry and 
              cry.Usstan could naut stop.Usstan climbed off the makeshift bridge 
              and crawled under it so nau one would see ussta tears.There on that 
              muddy bank usstan sobbed as usstan realized usstan had never grieved 
              for ussta parents.As the tears lifted the burden from ussta xukuth, 
              usstan understood now that the rage inside ussa had kept ussa from 
              following usstans true life path...usstan was never meant to be 
              a warrior, usstan did naut have the killer instict...</p>
            <p>*smiles at those who have stuck around to keep listening*</p>
            <p>If dos wish to get up and stretch dos may... usstan still has some 
              more to tell...chapter two if dos will *grin*</p>
            <p>*Takes a sip of wine and coninues...*</p>
            <p>So... after much praying to Innoruuk and consulting with Raynin... 
              it was decided; usstan would now pledge usstaself to being a loyal 
              priestess of Innoruuk.Raynin became ussta mentor, teaching usstan 
              all she had learned in her travels...*frowns slightly and then smiles*... 
              though she was naut always a gentle teacher. *hears chuckles from 
              those that knew Raynin* Usstan remember asking her,&quot;what does 
              the spell *gate* do&quot;.She said ,&quot;do dos have it scribed 
              and memmed?&quot;...usstan said,&quot;xas scribed it and memmed 
              back in Neriak when usstan bought it&quot;...she said,&quot;try 
              it and see...&quot;</p>
            <p>*snickers at her own juvenile ignorance*</p>
            <p>Any way was around this time Raynin would take naumore of ussta 
              lonely lifestyle...she dragged ussa by the ear into the Shadowclan 
              guildhall and initiated ussa as scrub.She gave ussa her glowing 
              wooden crook and then informed ussa that usstan would go hunting 
              with a young necromancer about ussa's age who went by the name Zerkil... 
              tho he was more commonly called the Necro-tank.Was naut too long 
              after that Raynin introduced usstan to Oubliette.She was a fiesty 
              little shadowknight with a big adittude ..psst..*wink* she still 
              is... shhh *holds finger to her lips*...The three of udos took to 
              elgging in the Lavastorm mountains..now listen carefully... because 
              this is how the whole Mama thing started for ussa...One moon, while 
              resting after a battle the three of udos started comparing udos 
              dreams...seems udos had all been having similar thoughts when udos 
              were asleep!Udos had all dreampt horribly of being rivvil*shudders* 
              But usstans nightmare was much worse then theirs.. because in usstans 
              night terror.. usstan was mated and had rivvil spawn!But as usstan 
              was explaining this to Dalninil Oub and Dalninuk Zerk, they started 
              laughing at usstan and saying, &quot;dos a mama! dos a mama!&quot;.Indignatley 
              usstan stalked off and decided to meditate elsewhere...usstan climbed 
              up onto the &quot;safe spot&quot; atop the mountain in Lavastorm 
              but usstan could still hear their teasing echoing up from down below...usstan 
              pretended to ignore them as usstan said prayers and tried to meditate 
              faster so udos could get back to battle and forget the foolishness.All 
              of a sudden some vile creature started attacking ussta abbils below!Usstan 
              jumped up from ussta meditations and ran to heal them...alas... 
              ahem...usstan was atop a mountain and running straight down the 
              cliff face did nauthing to help ussta bleeding abbils.Needless to 
              say udos all died.But rather than be angry at ussa for usstans foolishness, 
              they thought it was funny and were laughing harder than before!Oubliette 
              hugged ussa and said,&quot;See? Dos really are the Mama!Dos dove 
              off the cliff to save dos babies with nau thought to dos self!&quot; 
              and Zerkil's shouts rang off the mountains, &quot;MAMA XAYA! MAMA 
              XAYA!&quot; Usstan had to smile and agree...Usstan had indeed found 
              ussta calling and could deny it nau longer...usstan could nau longer 
              hide the maternal instincts usstan inherited from ussta mother...and 
              by embracing them, usstan found the peace usstan had been seeking 
              for so long.*saticfied smile*</p>
            <p>That was only the first of many times usstan fell off that mountain 
              trying to get to Oubliette or Zerkil or Kiaransalee or all three 
              *grin*...tho usstan pretty sure usstan fell down more sand dunes 
              than anything trying to get to Kia...*mind wanders a moment* As 
              ussta strength grew, Innoruuk gave usstan greater powers of healing 
              and blessing and usstan spent much more time caring for the waelin.Over 
              time this led ussa to ussta most humbly accepted role as Teir'dal 
              Mother for the Shadowclan. *smiles at her brood* Well, there dos 
              have it.. those that were interested in how usstan became the mommy 
              around here now know how it all came to be.</p>
            <p>*gets up and brushes off the some moss*</p>
            <p>Usstan think usstan will go now and relive some old memories...</p>
            <p>*startles some waelin shadowknights as she relieves them of their 
              beverages and heads off in the direction of The Lavastorm Mountains*</p>
