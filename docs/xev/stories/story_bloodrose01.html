            <p>......walking through the forest, she stops, looks around to see 
              if she is being followed. Continues to an opening in a tree, she 
              opens the secret passage that hides the life that grows. Pushing 
              the vines away to the side, she enters. Inside is a secret cavern, 
              a olath, moist place that has been kept hidden from all. In the 
              back is a garden. A vlos rose garden.</p>
            <p>The ground is soaked with vlos from the victims that were burried 
              there half alive, along with the viles of vlos that was poured onto 
              the ground to feed what grew there. The ground shudders as if to 
              be breathing....</p>
            <p>Bloodrose kneels beside the garden and reaches her hand towards 
              a rose while saying &quot;aahh dost all are ussa's dalharen, usstann 
              has grown dos all from less than seeds, fed dos all and kept dos 
              from the rivvils that plague this land. Ussatann's ogglin's have 
              never found dos all. Usstann's xukuth flows in everyone of dos. 
              Usstann has fed dos phlith, Ssin, verin, vlos, z'ress of the olath 
              faer, and the Ssinssrigg of all the verin usstann could pull from 
              Innoruuk.&quot; She bows her head in shame. &quot;Usstann has sat 
              here many moons watching the rays from the ever changing moons hit 
              dost peddals. Making dos all strong, while usstann poured vlos to 
              keep dost all from thirst&quot;. *She takes a deep heavy sigh*.</p>
            <p>&quot;Ahhh usstann precious dalharen, time is come to move&quot; 
              *a vlos tear drips from Bloodrose's sol* as she watched her flowers 
              move towards her. They sense her intentions. Pulling one rose from 
              the ground she craddles it in her arms as the others wrap their 
              viens around her. Bloodrose sit there listening to the screams of 
              the blood rose she has pulled from the ground. Feeling it's jiv'undus.</p>
            <p>*She gentlly touches it's pedals as to comfort the small one*</p>
            <p>.....After many hours in her garden she closes the entrance so 
              it will never be found again. *tears of vlos streamed her face* 
              &quot;Aluve usstanns Dalharen, ussa nau can attend to dos all nau 
              more.&quot; With the one single rose in her hands, she walks away.......feeling 
              the olathness that fills her soul. Peering up into the night air 
              as she listens to her roses scream...............</p>
            <p>As she walkes up the path and away from her dalharen, their cries 
              echo deep within her soul. Bowing her head, she grasps it within 
              her hands, their screams ripping her from within. She falls to her 
              knees and reallizes she can't take it no more. Rising from the ground 
              she turns and heads back to the hollowed tree to return to verin 
              that she knows. Upon opening the rocks and vines that covered the 
              entrance she steps inside to the verin that will always be hers.</p>
            <p>Walking into the center of the garden, she lays down amongest her 
              dalharen and as their vines wrap around her, she once again she 
              feels the verin and phlith run through her veins. This is where 
              she needs to be. She feels the ssinssrigg of their jiv'undus. &quot;Usstann 
              is so sorry, usstann will never think of leaving dos ever again 
              because ussa realizes leaving will only make usstann weak.&quot;</p>
            <p>Bloodrose rose from the garden to enter into a new realm of verin 
              and phlith.</p>
            <p>She stands in the entranceway, raises her harvester to Innoruuk 
              and cries</p>
            <p>....... &quot; The Verin one shall reign again&quot;...</p>
