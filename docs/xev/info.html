              <p>To have fun and provide some fun for those that oppose us.&nbsp; 
                We have developed into a large group of multi-game online players 
                that are dedicated to playing the evil monsters in the worlds 
                we frequent.&nbsp; We seek to expand our lands and to destroy 
                the "evil" human and good presence.&nbsp; By this, we hope to 
                provide a little role-played rivalry between us and the good races.&nbsp;

            <blockquote> 
              <p>We act and talk in character, as a monster would. If any Shadowclan 
                member does not follow at least basic role-playing she/he will 
                be stripped of his/her clan respect (Rank and Title). Also, if 
                this behavior persists they will be driven from the clan and forced 
                to roam the lands as a lone monster and to be treated as a Shadowclan 
                enemy. It is very important that these ideas be followed in order 
                to gain support from the other non-monster players in our worlds.</p>
              <p>We don't tolerate Humie company for long so never think yourself 
                a Shadowclan friend, even if we say you are :).&nbsp; If you helped 
                us, gave Booze or Food or talked to us in the past don't expect 
                amnesty from Shadowclan hostilities.&nbsp; As the old Monster 
                saying goes,"Shadowclan have many bad hair days and short memory".</p>
              <p><strong>On Languages:</strong> The Website presents <a href="languages.html">guidelines</a> 
                for how the typical member of each race speaks. The RP guidelines 
                are just that guidelines, designed to assist you in Roleplaying 
                your character. However, no cyber speak d00d, phat loots, pc, 
                afk, woot, etc. is tolerated since it is not part of the roleplay 
                world in Norrath. Aside from that make your character whatever 
                you want, whether mute iksar or troll speaking ogre (haha a little 
                humor). Note: Officers can address Any trends or behavior being 
                deemed as abusive or counter-productive to overall RP within SC

                will have until the next Gathering to convince a Minion to sponsor 
                them into the clan as a Brother/Sister. Until then they are considered 
                Recruits. This means that you will hold a given rank or Recruit, 
                or Brother/Sister, for at least 1 month's time between Gathering.

              <p><strong><a NAME="recruit"></a>RECRUIT</strong></p>
              <p> This is an individual that is petitioning to join Shadow Clan. 
                They have few rights but also more freedoms than one would expect. 
                Since they are probationary members, and not full members of the 
                clan they are usually picked on and ordered around a little, but 
                never so much that they would lose interest in joining the Clan. 
                Recruits may not always be invited on trips or entitled to any 
                of the loot, depending on the mood of those that they are with. 
                As a Recruit you must try to gain the trust and friendship of 
                minions and such, they will be the ones that vouch for your worthiness 
                to reach next rank.</p>
              <p> <strong>Eligibilty:</strong> All levels, evil races.<br>
                <strong>Powers:</strong> None<br>
                <strong>Rights:</strong> May come and go as they please, but this 
                may reflect badly on them though.<br>
                <strong>Duties:</strong><br>
                1. New Applicant applies via web site. <br>
                2. They are added to the Recruit Roster List on the web site.<br>
                3. They are guild invited by their race officer but do not have 
                access to the private boards, only the public ones<br>
                4. They have one month to find a mentor of Brother/Sister or Higher 
                rank. If after a month has passed they cannot find a mentor they 
                are booted. This makes them meet members to find a mentor. <br>
                5. It is common practice to seek out mentors of the recruit's 
                own profession and race, but is not necessary. <br>
                6. When they have a mentor they are made an Apprentice. They need 
                to contact the officers to get their title changed to Apprentice, 
                to get them full board access, to move to their race's roster, 
                and to make it known who their mentor is so it can be noted on 
                the rosters as well.<br>
                7. The change from Recruit top Apprentice can happen at anytime, 
                one does not have to wait until the Gathering though it is acceptable 
                to announce a choosing of an apprentice there.</p>

              <p><a NAME="apprentice"></a><strong>APPRENTICE</strong></p>
              <p> These members have managed to acquire a Mentor and are no longer 
                Recruits. They now must work with their mentor in order to obtain 
                their Mentor's approval for promotion later. They must obey the 
                orders of thos above them (within reason).
              <p><strong>Eligibilty:</strong> All levels, evil races. Must have 
                been a Recruit before and have found a Mentor.<br>

                1. They need to contact the officers to get their title changed 
                to Apprentice, to get them full board access, to move to their 
                race's roster, and to make it known who their mentor is so it 
                can be noted on the rosters as well. (yes this is duplicate from 
                Recruit duties in order to reinforce it's importance).<br>
                2. Apprentice post's name, age and class on Scrubdom/Apprentice 
                Forum. <br>
                3. Apprentice are required to complete a task before becoming 
                a true member. Your Mentor is responsible for your quest, not 
                the captains. This provides better individual support and introductions 
                to other clanmembers. The Mentor is required to post the quest 
                given on the scrub/apprentice forum. <br>
                4. The race's cabal or Elder's can alter the quest to maintain 
                fairness overall. Once quest is given, the apprentice has two 
                months to complete the quest.<br>
                5. When quest is completed they are made Brother/Sister at the 
                next gathering. Mentors are than free to take on another recruit. 
                <br>
                6. If quest is not completed in two months they are deguilded. 
                Mentors are than free to take on another apprentice. .<br>
                7. The change from Apprentice to Brother/Sister takes place at 
                the next gathering after they have completed their tasks and the 
                Mentor deems them ready.</p>

              <p>The Brother/Sister is the common rank in the clan once trial 
                periods are completed. They are expected to follow the orders 
                of there superiors and to do as they're told. Brother/Sisters 
                that show that they are loyal to the clan will eventually be promoted 
                to the rank of Minion. Advancement from here depends on your Roleplaying 
                ability, dedication to the clan, and the Interaction with the 
                clan.... Officers must vouch for your ability and worthiness to

                Recruits up to Brother/Sister rank they are then eligible to become 
                Minions, though they will still need to gain the support of a

              <p> These positions have many other nicknames, Recruit smackas, 
                captuns, dark inquisitors, etc... seems a version is created which 
                bears better meaning to the race of which the Captain is in charge 
                of. Each race has one captain (Dark Elves having 2 when member 
                list becomes too unwieldy). The Captains are in charge of traiing 
                new Recruits for their race. They guide, beat, teach, and evaluate 
                the young ones to be certain they will meet the Clans standards. 
                If they fail in the eyes of the captains, then a Recruit is as 
                good as troll food. The Captains are not class specific so any

			  <p><a NAME="oracle"></a><strong>ORACLE</strong></p>
              <p>There is an artifact within the clan that is said to give its 
                owner the ability to speak to the gods. This artifact possesses 
                strange and mysterious powers but is disguised as something that 
                would not seem out of place in one's pack. He who possesses this 
                artifact has great power, but is also in great danger. He who 
                posses the artifact rarely has it for long, as it is the single 
                most coveted item within the clan. Many will do anything to posses 
                it...</p>
              <p> <strong>Eligibility:</strong><br>
                1. Current Oracle can remain Oracle if no one challenges him,

                those competing to gang up and topple the old dictator, that is 
                up to you.<br>
                2. All Races in Shadowclan are permitted to compete, but this 
                is a Caster only contest so brutish melee classes are not allowed.... 
                rogues, monks, warriors, and Shadowknights are the ones <b>not</b> 
                allowed to compete. Those competing for Oracle must be Brothers/Sisters

                1. Provide spiritual guidance for the clan by means of dreams, 
                visions, scrying, tossing the bones, reading the cards, etc. This 
                Guidance is what will motivate the clan &quot;rpwise&quot; to 
                go out and do things in Norrath. Having a Dream of a horde of 
                hopping frogluks charging the clans homelands is a sure sign that 
                the Dark gods wish clan to go kill the Frogluks before they kill

            <blockquote> 
              <p>ShadowClan is not democratic. However, all its members are encouraged 
                to participate in discussions of clan policy. Votes on clan policy 
                will ultimately be made by the Elder, Dark Cabals, the Race Captains, 
                and the Oracle. Votes can be over-ridden by the Clan Elders if 
                he chooses to do so.
              <p>Policy discussion threads can be started by a Dark Cabal member 
                or their designee in order to query the membership for different 
                opinions and ideas. Votes will then be held by a Dark Cabal member 
                when they feel discussion is over. If you have an issue you believe 
                needs to be discussed, submit a request to your Dark Cabal member.
			  <p>Election of Dark Cabal - is accomplished by a vote of the clan 
                members who are of that race. There is one Dark Cabal member per 
                each of the four evil races... Tier'dal, Iksar, Ogre, and Troll. 
                So, for example, if we need a new Ogre Dark Cabal member, then 
                all Ogres of Minion status would get to vote on nominees approved 
                by the current Cabal. The vote will be posted by a current member 
                of Dark Cabal rank.
<p>Nominees for Dark Cabal positions can be sent to the current 
                Cabal members. The Dark Cabal may interview the candidates if 
                they wish, and will then pick those that they feel can best handle 
                the position. The nominees approved by the Cabal will then be 
                voted on.
<p>When an individual is elected to the Cabal and assumes an OOC 
                leadership position, ANY and ALL other official IG leadership 
                roles and titles will be removed. (With the exception of Clan 
                Craftsmen titles since these are skill based).
<p>OOC leaders have the authority to make decisions on guild warfare, 
                promotions and demotions, banning, humie guild relationships, 
                looting, epic, raiding rules, general clan policy, inner guild 
                disputes, external guild disputes, clan auction, the clan bank, 
                and any other subjects which require OOC leadership and direction. 
                They are also the OOC contacts for other players and groups... 
                if you need to contact Shadowclan, contact members of the Dark 
                Cabal.
              <p>Replacement of Dark Cabal - if the need should ever arise for 
                whatever reason, there are 2 methods to remove a dark cabal. The 
                first, the members of a specific race may deem it necessary to 
                oust their own Dark Cabal representative. This has never been 
                attempted, therefore it can also be said that there have never 
                been any survivors! The second, The Clan leaders may take the 
                issue to discussion amongst themselves an vote a Cabal out if 
                necessary. If this need should arise then we have faith that the 
                Dark Gods will show us the way to accomplish it.

            <h3><a NAME="gathering"></a>The Gathering:</h3>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>The gods have willed that once a Norrathian Year* a new Shadow 
                Lord will rise to power from the ashes of the old. This prevents 
                the clan from drifting away from the gods under the banner of 
                a single powerful and charismatic leader. As such it is the will 
                of the Gods that on or around the dawning of a Norrathian Year* 
                a competition will be held to decide who is worthy to lead the 
                clan. This takes place each month on the 15th day.
              <p>The clansmen competing announce their desire to compete and from 
                those hopefuls, the ones who will compete are selected by the 
                Dark Cabal. They then compete in a series of one on one elimination 
                battles, until only one remains standing... this is the New Shadowlord.
<p>The Shadow Lord competition is open to Warriors types only, no 
                mage or priest may enter. It is feared that if a Dark Elf was 
                allowed to compete he might rise to power through the use of trickery 
                and underhanded tactics. If this happened he might not have the 
                backing to lead the brutes and could instead lead the clan to 
                civil war. Hence it is not common to see a Dark Elf in this battle. 
                The competition is a brute force match although it's not uncommon 
                for everything from throwing axes and poisons to make it into 
                the battle. Shadowknights are known to use the powers of their 
                god in the battle as well. The Shadow Lord is regarded by the 
                Ogres and Trolls as the most powerful figure in the clan. He is 
                to be feared and his every command to be followed to the letter. 
                Rarely is he directly challenged. Dark Elves have been known to 
                feign more respect then they actually have for him though, privately 
                regarding him as a puppet.
<p>From time to time figureheads of various titles among the mystics 
                and priests have risen to power and become powerful advisers to 
                the Shadow Lord. There is no set means for how this happens, nor 
                does this always occur. Sometimes the figure comes to power as 
                an adviser to the current Shadow Lord. At other times it has been 
                known to occur when a weaker Shadow Lord comes to power shifting 
                the balance more in favor of the Dark Elves. This Grand Mystic 
                or High Prophet is most commonly a Dark Elf but has been known 
                to be a shaman from time to time as well, depending on who the 
                Shadow Lord favors.
<p>(*Norrathian year equals a Real World Month, The Gathering is 
                on the 15th of Each Month.)
