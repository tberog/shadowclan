                a group. Or drop the group and form a new one if necessary.</li>
              <li>If you must group with non-evil races, ensure you roleplay harass

            <h3><a NAME="loot"></a>Loot Rules</h3>
            <ul>
              <li> <strong>SINGLE GROUP:</strong> If on an <u>ALL CLAN</u> hunt... 
                any loot acquired will go to a member in the group that will <strong>USE 
                IT</strong>. If more then one <strong>will use</strong>, then 
                will random amongst the ones able to use it. Else it stays in 
                clan for auction or passing on to someone who can use it in clan 
                (yes, this rule carries over to multi-group raids as well). <strong>If 
                not</strong> a clan group then random as usual.</li>
              <li><strong>Multi-Group raids:</strong> On any raid which requires 
                more than one group of 6, and which the Shadowclan dictates the 
                loot policies, the following rules apply:</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><strong>Need Over Greed:</strong></p>
              <p>When an item drops, all those who are present that can use and 
                <strong>would use</strong> the item will /random for it, being 
                <strong>careful NOT to /random</strong> until the raid leader 
                has said so, with the victor getting the spoils. Once a person 
                has won an item on that particular raid, they are<strong> excluded</strong> 
                from future /randoms on that raid until everyone of that class 
                has attained an item. The <strong>raid leader or designated loot 
                caller will call out when to roll and for what item</strong>.</p>
              <p>Guidelines:</p>
              <ol>
                <li> Loot is determined by a /random roll, with the highest roll 
                  winning the prize.</li>
                <li>The numbers rolled for an item are decided on by the Raid 
                  Leader or the person he/she designates. Following exceptions 
                  to the norm:<br>
                  <strong>a)</strong> Must post attendance on raid posts, or will 
                  be reated as late..<br>
                  <strong>b)</strong> If late or didnt respond to raid post then 
                  1 hour wait until can roll.<br>
                  <strong>c)</strong> Raid leader will call out classes to roll 
                  on an item if the item is an all/all item.</li>
                <li>Only group leaders are to look into corpses or for the loot. 
                  <br>
                  Everyone that is on the raid is entitled to a fair chance for 
                  loot, both Clan members and invites. On the other hand, those 
                  that participate on the &quot;break&quot; of a particular raid 
                  may be entitled to additional benefits, as determined by the 
                  raid leader and stated BEFORE the raid. (this can be +200 to 
                  rolls, etc)</li>
                <li>If an item drops that your class can use but you do not want, 
                  you are not required to random for it. You can also roll and 
                  if you win it, offer it to another on the raid that can use 
                  it.</li>
                <li> You are only eligible to /random for an item if:<br>
                  <strong>a)</strong> You have not already won something on that 
                  trip or<br>
                  <strong>b)</strong> All those that could use the item had already 
                  won something on that trip.</li>
                <li>There may be special situations where an item will be given 
                  to a particular person without a /random. Example: an epic quest 
                  item drops and it's the last piece that a particular person 
                  needs for the quest, this must be stated by the raid leader 
                  PRIOR to the beginning of that particular raid.</li>
                <li>When in doubt, the raid leader has final say, backed by the 
                  attending guild officers. If you have a question, refer back 
                  to this rule.</li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>Notes and Exceptions:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Late Players:</strong> Late players can not roll for 
                  an item until they have been a part of the raid for one hour. 
                  They need to confirm time they arrived with the raid leader 
                  so both on same page as to when that hour is up. As always everyone 
                  is encouraged to show up on time to make forming groups, buffing, 
                  etc, go as smooth as possible and without delays. Obviously 
                  this is not always possible and it is better late then never. 
                  Attempts to get late players into raid will be made at the raid&#8217;s 
                  convenience, but sometimes it will just not be possible for 
                  numerous reasons such as no porters, no CoH, raid to deep, etc.</li>
                <li><strong>Alt Players and Loot:</strong> When people do a raid 
                  they are encouraged to have one character. If a person has two 
                  or more attending a raid, using two or more computers, they 
                  decided which one would be their main for looting purposes. 
                  Obviously it is poor form to have a second logged in character 
                  chosen as an alt rolling against mains, especially when the 
                  alt&#8217;s main is playing at the same time on the same raid. 
                  If something is going to rot then logging in another to loot 
                  or deferring to an alt also makes sense. Basically rolling for 
                  loot is one player per raid and not per character on a raid 
                  when a person is playing more then one character at the same 
                  time. When someone volunteers for a CRITICAL raid role to bring 
                  alt along for raid instead of a main, then the alt for THAT 
                  raid should roll as anyone on raid does since they are there 
                  in a critical raid role MAIN roll. A typical example is an alt 
                  cleric needing to be played because there are no other clerics. 
                  No one is REQUIRED to play any particular character, but volunteering 
                  is never discouraged when there is a critical need. Alt characters 
                  are also expected to take a back seat to mains when the need 
                  arises to have alt for critical classes and a main show up at 
                  a later time.</li>
                <li><strong>Raid Roles for Alts and Invites.</strong> During raids 
                  there are some specific roles assumed by players and classes. 
                  Examples often included puller(s), raid organizer, enchanter(s) 
                  (speed/clarity), shaman (slow/buffing), necro (buffing/dots) 
                  etc. Invites and alts will defer by defaults they roles to clans 
                  and mains, unless an agreement is worked to the clan or mains 
                  satisfaction. Just because an invite or alt is a high level 
                  then a clan member on the raid does not imply they get the role 
                  filled automatically.</li>
                <li><strong>Participation:</strong> Participation is expected 
                  to not show favoritism to classes. Example clan clerics are 
                  expected to participate in fear raids even though their class 
                  armor does not drop there.</li>
                <li><strong>Invites:</strong> If you want to invite someone on 
                  a clan raid check with the raid leader and get it approved. 
                  If there is a sign up for the raid on the message board have 
                  them post. Other evil races, friends of the clan, and small 
                  guilds with the same play style of the clan&#8217;s are welcome 
                  to attend clan functions so long as raid leader is aware and 
                  approves.</li>
                <li><strong>God Items:</strong> All non-epic God items will be 
                  straight randomed to all that can use it regardless if they 
                  had already won an item. (God's only spawn once a week, and 
                  their items are not counted as plane gear.) If multiple god 
                  item drop winners will not take in future rolls for god items 
                  during the remainder of the raid. One god item per player per 
                  raid.</li>
                <li><strong>Epic Quest Items:</strong> These quest items will 
                  go to the highest leveled race/class that needs it the most. 
                  Clan members working on their epics are expected to take an 
                  active role in organizing and leading raids for their epic. 
                  The clan&#8217;s resource are available to help acquire epics 
                  but it is not the clan&#8217;s responsibility to lead and organize 
                  raid just for individual&#8217;s to get their epics. On a normal 
                  hunt and much like the general rule of, &quot;If it's the last 
                  piece you need to complete your planar suit, you get that piece&quot;, 
                  there will ba a similar stipulation in Epic drops. If someone 
                  completed, for example, 90% of their epic and needed a piece 
                  or two to finish - AND Another character was only 30% done with 
                  theirs, then the one most complete with quest would get it. 
                  Note, If someone organizes the raid to get a quest piece, they 
                  would get the piece when it drops.</li>
                <li><strong>Spells:</strong> IF a spell drops from a creature. 
                  All who are present that can currently cast the spell or are 
                  within ONE level of being able to cast the spell will random 
                  for the spell. If none qualify then the spell will be banked 
                  in the Clan Vault and given freely to the first Clan member 
                  to reach the appropriate age to Scribe it.</li>
                <li><strong>Non-Rare Gems/items</strong>: Non-rare gems and items 
                  (such as emerald rings, pages, etc.) are looted by group leaders. 
                  Group leader then give these gems/items to the group cleric 
                  to cover the expenses of their reagents required to buff the 
                  tanks. Pages and Words are handed out to the appropriate caster 
                  class.</li>
                <li><strong>Rare Gems:</strong> All rare gems, diamond, blue diamond, 
                  jancinth, and black sapphires are turned over to a clan representative 
                  to be use for jewelry making. Jewelry made from clan raids will 
                  either go back to the raid participants or auctioned off to 
                  clan member on the message board.</li>
                <li>Breastplates and Robes: Do NOT count towards the &quot;1 Item 
                  Only&quot; rule. They are the exception.<br>
                  <u>Example:</u> If &quot;Necrobob&quot; wins a Bracer and then 
                  a BP drops later, &quot;Necrobob&quot; can also /random for 
                  the BP. If &quot;Necrojohn&quot; wins a BP first however, &quot;Necrojohn&quot; 
                  can not roll for the Bracer if it drops afterwards. The Breastplate/Robe 
                  counts as the 1 Drop IF it is won first. So it is possible that 
                  one Raid Member can win 2 pieces before anyone else wins one 
                  IF the BP/Robe was the second item won. But, from prior experience... 
                  this is a one in thousand scenario.</li>
                <li><strong>The Final Piece of a Set:</strong> If an item drops 
                  that would complete a persons full set of his class's armor, 
                  then that person gets that drop by default. The exception to 
                  this rule is a Breastplate or Robe. Those are /randomed as usual. 
                  Though this may sound unfair at first, remember that the person 
                  who needs only one item will not touch the other items of that 
                  class that may drop. So others of same class have better chance 
                  to obtain those pieces.</li>
                <li><strong>Plane of Fear:</strong> Cryosilk pieces will be randomed 
                  to Enchanters and Mages first.</li>
                <li><strong>Plane of Hate:</strong> Cryosilk pieces from chests 
                  will be randomed to Necros and Wizards.</li>

            <h3><a NAME="anon"></a>Anon and Roleplay Switch</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Shadowclan <strong>prohibits</strong> the use of the <strong>&quot;/Anon&quot;</strong> 
                filter. The use of this hides you from the other members of Shadowclan 
                as well hides your Guild tag from view, Guild Tags are to be displayed 
                with pride at all times.</li>
              <li>The <strong>&quot;/roleplay&quot;</strong> switch <strong>DOES 
                NOT HIDE YOU FROM /WHO GUILD ALL</strong> any longer. Recent changes 
                by Verant now allow us to see any member even while using /roleplay. 
                So, /roleplay is allowed for Peon ranks and above. The Scrubs 
                may not use it since they are being watched by the Captains during 
                this period.</li>
              <li>The Planes: While a clansman is up in any of the Planes, they 
                are allowed to use the <strong>/roleplay</strong> filter in order 
                to hide location from the casual viewer. Some people look to see 
                who is in what Planes then they may run in to take advantage of 
                the other / first groups hard work. To prevent this event, <strong>/roleplay 
                is allowed regardless of Rank</strong> while IN the Plane. Also, 
                Planes are high lag areas so the less people rushing in the better.</li>

            <h3><a NAME="parting"></a>The parting of ways</h3>
            <blockquote><p>There are those that leave the clan to follow their own desires 
              and paths. Many go, many return. Those that were once in Shadowclan 
              and wish to return will begin anew and will lose a RANK to prove 
              their worth to clan once more. There will be no need for review 
              or any such judgments if the clansmen left of their own free will 
              before and on good terms. But those that were forcibly removed must 
              request to return and the leadership will discuss this and then 
              take a vote on the acceptance or denial of the member.</p></blockquote>
