    <p><span id="internal-source-marker_0.2862176194829358">The   initiate is brought into a room blindfolded. Her nostrils flare as she   catches a familiar acrid smell, blood. ‘Remove the blindfold of the   xaari, the apprentice’. Her blindfold is removed and while her vision   readjusts to the dim light in the chamber she sees a pot of blood, and a   hooded figure in a red robe. ‘Leave now’ the figure says to the two   figures, also dressed in red robes, who leave silently and without   saying a word. Looking down at herself she sees that she as well is   dressed in a crimson red robe that matches her robe color.</span><br />
      <br />
      ‘You   have reached the age of maturity and your family wishes for your   induction into our clan but first before you join you must learn our   ways’ the figure speaks to the initiate as he slowly walks around her.   ‘You are hereditary and born into our order but before you join us fully   you will learn our lessons and follow them. To not do so is to invite   death unto yourself so that your family’s honor in our order is   maintained.’ The xaari does not move at this and the robed figure speaks   ‘Good, you understand that and knew that beforehand. I expect that from   one born into our order. Sometimes we do recruit promising initiates   though when we can catch them young enough that their minds are   receptive to our teachings and then they can learn that after they join   us and learn our secrets it will be death to them if they leave. Some do   not know that but they quickly learn’ and while speaking the robed   figure pulls out a dagger and runs it slowly over his palm over and   over. ‘You know, of course, of our name and that the rest of the Empire   views us as a group of Empire loyalists who are more of a social club if   you will. They however do not know of our history and traditions but I   shall reiterate them to you’ and the figure moves up to an altar in the   room before continuing.<br />
      <br />
      ‘We,   those of the shadows , were born as a group on Korriban before the   coming of the Jen’jidai. Our roots are found with the great King Adas,   the Sith’ari, he who conquered the planet with prowess in battle and   mastery of Sith magic and strew all the broken bodies of his enemies   before him. The great Adas had his lieutenant, his Shadow Hand, and we   were recruited as a small group to move through the Empire as shadows   and slay all those who threatened the Empire. After Adas joined with the   Force while driving back an enemy that thought it could defeat us and   ravaged their worlds we followed his successors always in the shadows,   waiting, watching, and learning what we could from the holocron that the   great Adas had prepared for us when he foresaw the arrival of an   ancient enemy and how he would join with the Force to defeat it.’<br />
      <br />
      ‘When   the Jen’jidai came they were proven to the successors of Adas and Adas   worked through the Force to lead them here. This is shown by the fact   that they carried a mastery of Sith magic, even greater weapons and,   most importantly, they won. This could not have happened without the   blessing of Adas. The strong shall always overcome and weakness will be   driven out.’<br />
      <br />
      ‘After   the Jen’jidai arrived and we joined with them we became saarai-kaar,   those who keep and guard the truth. We integrated the spirit of Adas   with the Emperor and as long as the Emperor remains strong and the one   who best keeps the spirit of the Empire the spirit of Adas stays with   him. If another comes who is stronger then the spirit of Adas leaves and   makes the stronger the Sith’ari. We serve the spirit of Adas and we   move through the Empire and eliminate the threats to the Sith’ari.’<br />
      <br />
      ‘We   are wide spread and from all walks of life. There are warriors and   slaves and merchants who serve us and as we wish to move as shadows,   learning about all the threats to the Sith’ari and vanquishing them,   they come from all over. Of course though we keep our blood Sith; the   aliens are weak and impure and only should serve and never the other way   around. It is heresy to suggest that those who are descended from Sith   should join us.’<br />
      <br />
      ‘With   time you will decide what shall be your calling whether it be jenassi,   massassi or adassi. You will go now and start your lessons with a   jen’ari of our order. You will learn what we know of the Sith tongue and   among ourselves you will speak it. It is your choice and your calling   outside of our ranks but within our ranks we honor the fact we are Sith   with our original tongue. You will learn the ways of the Force and you   will learn how to make each other strong and eliminate the weak so that   we may always get stronger and, most importantly, you will learn the   path that will better allow you to protect the Sith’ari and our mighty   Empire and slay those who pose a threat. Now, give me your hand so that I   may cut it and mingle your blood in the cup with the blood of those who   have gone before you and then you may meet the jen’ari who will teach   you.<br />
      <br />
    Who   we are:   We are a Sith cult following Adas.  Our characters are   descendants, physically and/or spiritually, of the Shadow Hand that   served Adas and we wish to see the domination of the Sith Empire.  We   believe the spirit of Adas imbues someone and makes this person the   Sith’ari; the perfect Sith.  For now, we believe the Emperor has the   spirit of Adas and we are dedicated to stamping out threats to the Sith   Empire and helping with the Empire’s conquests. </p>
