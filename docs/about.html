<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#cccccc">Shadowclan began in 
October 1997 when a handful of players in Ultima Online on the Great Lakes 
shard decided to take the place of the stupid AI monsters and provide a more 
intelligent enemy. They were the first Shadowclan Orcs, and lived out of a
tent. From the beginning, they roleplayed and stayed in-character as orcs.</font></font>
 </p>
 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#cccccc">Soon after that, Shadowclan 
moved to the Catskills shard and into the orc fort South of the City of Yew. 
The clan grew and thus did the intensity at the orc fort.&nbsp; Battles became 
commonplace. Other roleplayers flocked to Catskills, and with some publicity, 
the population of Shadowclan skyrocketed.&nbsp; For years, the battles at 
the officially recognized Shadowclan fort&nbsp; continued all day long, every 
day.</font></font> </p>
 
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#cccccc">Today, Shadowclan has 
brought its unique playstyle to several other games, and will take it to any
game where there is enough interest.</font></font> <br>
 &nbsp; <br>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#cccccc"><font size="+2">What
 makes Shadowclan so fun?</font></font></font></p>
 </center>
    
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#cccccc">Thousands of players
 have been a part of Shadowclan.&nbsp; Here are some reasons why:</font></font>
 </p>
 
<ul>
  <li> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#cccccc"><font
 size="+1">Having  fun</font><i> </i>- Key to being a Shadowclan member is
having fun at what  you are doing, without ruining the fun of others.&nbsp;
We love to provide  people with an enemy they enjoy fighting.</font></font></li>
   <li> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#cccccc"><font
 size="+1">Roleplay</font> - Shadowclan members are required to be in-character 
at all times while in-game.&nbsp; We specialize in non-human roleplay, especially 
orcs and other races of similar behavior/mentality. We have a strong racial 
identity and a general dislike of the other races.</font></font></li>
   <li> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#cccccc"><font
 size="+1">Open Membership</font> - Anyone is welcome to join Shadowclan with
a new character that conforms to Shadowclan policies.</font></font></li>
   <li> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#cccccc"><font
 size="+1">Community &amp; cooperation</font> - Nothing is more important 
to Shadowclan members than the Shadowclan community itself.&nbsp; Everything 
is shared and expected to remain within the community.&nbsp; Shadowclan combat 
tactics are often non-conventional and emphasize cooperation rather than individual
skill.</font></font></li>
   <li> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#cccccc"><font
 size="+1">Respect</font> - Shadowclan members are expected to be mature members
of the player community, treating fellow players with respect.</font></font></li>
   <li> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#cccccc"><font
 size="+1">Quality</font> - We train our new members in the Shadowclan ways, 
and expect them to act appropriately.</font></font></li>
   <li> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#cccccc"><font
 size="+1">Combat</font> - If the game supports it, Player versus Player combat,
as it fits within our roleplay, is a key part of Shadowclan.</font></font></li>
   <li> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#cccccc"><font
 size="+1">Committed characters</font> - While we have open membership, we 
expect characters in Shadowclan to join when their character is created and 
for that character to stay in Shadowclan.&nbsp; This promotes sharing and 
cooperation between members as they know that aiding their fellow members 
will be aiding Shadowclan.&nbsp; Characters that become traitors to Shadowclan 
are treated very poorly, and their players  are prohibited from rejoining 
Shadowclan.&nbsp; Shadowclan members can of course join  other guilds with 
their non-Shadowclan characters.</font></font></li>
   <li> <font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#cccccc"><font
 size="+1">Game Friendly</font> - Our storyline and background blend in with 
game's storyline and background to the highest degree possible.&nbsp; We won't
force other players to break character in order to match our own roleplay 
style.&nbsp; We follow the rules of the game.&nbsp; No cheating, bug exploiting, 
illegal 3rd party programs, or other violations of the game's Terms of Service 
are ever allowed.</font></font></li>
   
</ul>
