  <h3>Why Join?</h3>
  <p>Shadowclan is an open-membership guild dedicated to roleplaying &quot;the
    enemy&quot;. We started in Ultima Online as a guild of player-character Orcs;
    since then we have opened branches in numerous other games, always dedicated
    to playing a limited selection of 'evil' (or, rather, 'misunderstood') races,
    providing enjoyable enemies for the mainstream player to oppose. In Shadowbane,
    we are a Virakt, a guild made up exclusively of Irekei, a race hated and feared
    by every other faction in the lore. </p>
  <p>As a guild, we are dedicated both to high-quality roleplaying, and to highly
    effective PVP. As a Shadowclan Irekei, you will be expected to take on the
    persona of one of the most dangerous creatures on the face of Aerynth, and
    roleplay that character fully. We do not talk smack with our enemies; our
    goal is to create a vibrant, immersive, lore-compliant, and deadly Irekei
    nation. Note that we do not automatically kill all fir'khanim on sight; we
    will collect tribute when convenient, and may occasionally even coordinate
    military actions with non-Irekei guilds against a common foe.</p>
  <h2>Irekei</h2>
  <p>The Irekei are a race of desert warriors, made harsh by a harsh climate.
    Our unifying goal as a people is to reawaken the Dragon, Terror of Terrors,
    triggering the Great Burning which will rid Aerynth of all lesser peoples
    and create a paradise for those Irekei found to be worthy. The official information
    on the Irekei can be found <a href="http://chronicle.ubi.com/Encyclopedia/Races/Irekei.htm" target="_blank">here</a>;
    pay particular attention to the pages <a href="http://chronicle.ubi.com/Encyclopedia/Races/Irekei.htm?AddInfo=People" target="_blank">Their
    People</a>, <a href="http://chronicle.ubi.com/Encyclopedia/Races/Irekei.htm?AddInfo=Ways" target="_blank">Their
    Ways</a>, and <a href="http://chronicle.ubi.com/Encyclopedia/Races/Irekei.htm?AddInfo=Lore" target="_blank">Their
    Lore</a>. To briefly sum up, Irekei are arrogant, xenophobic, unforgiving,
    aloof, and we worship the mightiest enemy of the All-Father, the god most
    of Aerynth follows. <br />
