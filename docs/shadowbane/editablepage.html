<!-- Updates should be placed only between Comment Tags marked as "Edit Text Begins" and "Edit Text Ends"
There are 4 levels of Text: H1 for main heading, H2 for sub-headings, H5 for cutlines and sub-sub-headings, and P for all ordinary text.
Links will automatically appear as defined by the style sheet.
Do not edit any of the DIV tags.
There are 4 DIV IDs:
1) TOP contains the image at the top of the page. This DIV does not need to be edited by page or section updaters. This DIV contains no text.
2) LEFT contains the menu in the left column. Standard HTML hyperlink rules apply. Each link is separated by the XMTL tag <br />
3) MIDDLE contains the copy for the page. Follow nomal HTML 4 rules or XMTL rules as defined by the W3C XHTML 1.0 Transitional DTD. Allowable tags are <P></P>, <H1></H1>, <H2></H2>, <H5></H5>. Please do not use non-breaking spaces to indent paragraph beginnings, all copy is flush left/ragged right.
If you insert a table into this column please do not used fixed-width table or cell setings, the MIDDLE column floats to match the width of the browser window. Do not fix a table width, but do fix cell widths at percentages of 100 (i.e., 3 columnn tables would have cell widths of 33,33,33).
Images set into the middle column should be no wider than 250 pixels in order to avoid odd behaviours. Do not insert images without optimizing them for web viewing and specifying the image's dimensions in the tag.
4) RIGHT DIV ID is for supplementalinformation, highlighting points of importance and for small images no wider than 110 pixels.
A note on IMAGES: by default only small size images appear on any full page. If there is a need for a larger image to appear, link the smaller image to the larger image and have the larger appear alone in its own browser window. the IMG tag should indicate target="blank" in order for this to work.

  <!-- Edit Text Begins -->
  <p>This is the middle column for the page's main text. The formatting of the
    text and positioning of the columns are all controlled by the CSS file. Do
    not mess with any of that stuff.</p>
  <p>Using a text editor or text view of an HTML editor please read the instructions
    contained in the comments in the HEAD of this page.</p>
  <p>DO NOT USE NETSCAPE COMPOSER.</p>
  <p>DO NOT USE ANY MICROSOFT PRODUCT BUT NOTEPAD TO EDIT THIS PAGE.</p>
  <p>The page layout is controlled by the style sheet referenced in the head.
    DO NOT edit the style sheet. DO NOT edit the page to format the style of the
    words or paragraphs, the style sheet on the site will do all of that automatically.</p>
  <p>DO make sure the stylesheet is at the same directory level as the page you
    create.</p>
  <p>Unless you also download the style sheet and also have a good HTML editor,
    the page will not appear on your hard drive in the same way as it will on
    the website. Do not trust your WYSIWYG editors to render the page properly
    -- they are generally incapable of doing so.</p>
