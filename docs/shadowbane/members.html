  <h3>Expectations of Members</h3>

  <h2>Roleplay and Conduct</h2>

  <p>Stay in-character - No references to the world outside of Shadowbane. Use

    of the Irekei Language is strongly encouraged. (Note: If your character name

    is inappropriate you will not be allowed to join Shadowclan). </p>

  <p>Have fun without ruining the fun of others. </p>

  <p>Come prepared to learn. Expect at the very least a 30 day training period

    before you are allowed full membership status in Shadowclan. We have high

    expectations that members must achieve and maintain. </p>

  <p>Come prepared to share and sacrifice. Shadowbane is a community where each

    individual is expected to work for the improvement of that community rather

    than individual gain. Lower ranked members are often restricted in the types

    of equipment they may use and everyone is restricted as far as personal wealth

    is concerned. </p>

  <h6>NO EXPLOITS</h6>

  <p>Shadowclan members do not abuse bugs, cheats, external programs or ways to

    gain power or wealth that the developers of the game did not intend to be

    used.</p>

  <h6>LOYALTY</h6>

  <p>Shadowclan (and Irekei in particular) are fiercely loyal to their group (Virakt).</p>



  <h2>Rules for Shadowclan</h2>

  <h5>Chain of Command:</h5>

  <p>All characters are expected to follow the chain of command.</p>

  <h2>Out-of-Game Behaviour:</h2>

  <p>All Shadowclan members are expected to be mature in actions if not years.

    Any immature behaviour by a Shadowclan Player reflects badly on the guild

    as a whole, especially if done under the Shadowclan name or the character's

    name. </p>
