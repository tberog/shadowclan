  <h2>Runes</h2>
  <p>Raising your stats is not the only thing you can do with your stat points.
    Both during character creation and ongoing gameplay, you have the opportunity
    to spend stat points to apply runestones instead; note that you can only apply
    a total of 8 runestones plus your required race, class, and professions runes.
    Also, just because you can take runes doesn't necessarily mean you should;
    in a large number of cases, using those points to raise your stats will provide
    more benefit than buying the runestone does. Runes have a wide variety of
    possible effects, falling into several broad categories: </p>
  <h5>Cap increase: </h5>
  <p>You can use runestones to raise your stat cap in one or more attributes.
    During creation, you can apply either a +5 current/ +5 max rune for 6 points
    (requires you already have 40 in the stat), or a +10 current/ +10 max rune
    for 12 points (requires 50). If you can get your key stat to 50 and have 12
    points left, a +10 rune is probably one of the best stones you can take during
    character creation. Then, during gameplay, you have the option to apply another
    +cap stone ranging from +5 to +40 (with the stronger stones requiring a greater
    stat-point cost, of course); you can easily end up with a capped stat 50 points
    higher than your natural cap if you build your character toward that end.
    Note again, though, that you don't have anywhere near enough stat points to
    cap all your attributes, even less so once you've applied runestones; don't
    waste a Legendary or Godly stone if you're never going to be able to fill
    it up. </p>
  <h5>Cap shuffle: </h5>
  <p>In addition to the simple +cap runes, during character creation you can purchase
    reduced-cost runes that raise one stat and its cap by 10 each, at the cost
    of -5 to two other stats and their caps. In each case except one, you're losing
    points from either Int or Con which you'd end up buying back later, making
    these runes a suboptimal investment in most cases; however, Warlord's Page
    is an excellent rune for a heavy-armor melee class, boosting Con at the expense
    of Dex and Spirit you have no use for anyway. </p>
  <h5> Skill increase: </h5>
  <p>You can buy stones during character creation to raise any weapon skill, most
    armor and defensive skills, and the basic magical skills of mages or healers.
    These runes were a good purchase in the past; however, with the new lower
    gold cost of training skills, it's probably better to spend points into your
    Intelligence (or other attributes) than to use them purchasing skill runes.
  </p>
  <h5>Proficiency: </h5>
  <p>For 10 points, you can wield a weapon not normally allowed to your class.
    If you have a strong roleplay character concept requiring out-of-class weapons,
    this is the only way to go, but from a game mechanics standpoint, there are
    very few builds which demand the use of an extra proficiency... especially
    since you'll generally have to purchase a mastery rune later to get maximum
    effect from your new weapon. </p>
  <h5>Resistances: </h5>
  <p>There are runestones which boost magical resistances to various elements,
    as well as one which will boost your physical resistances by 5 points each.
    Irekei start with heightened resistance to fire but a weakness against cold;
    Blood of the North (that's &quot;North Kharduun&quot;, of course =) isn't
    a bad choice if you have 4 points to spare, and some melee characters may
    think Tough Hide worth its 12 points. </p>
  <h5>Regeneration: </h5>
  <p>Stamina, Health, and Mana each have a runestone which provides a flat bonus
    to the attribute pool as well as boosting your regen rate for that pool. While
    these may look tempting, the bonuses they currently provide are trivial at
    higher levels; pass them by. </p>
  <h5>Attack/Defense: </h5>
  <p>You can buy an 8-point rune which will add +5% to your ATR or DEF. This will
    only boost a 1000 ATR to 1050; these points might be better spent in Intelligence
    or another stat which will provide a broader benefit in multiple areas. </p>
  <h5>Other abilities: </h5>
  <p>Ambidexterity, increased run speed, and see invisible round out the starting
    runestone list. The ambidexterity rune is the only way for a Warrior to wield
    2 weapons, but is costly; the other two of these stones may be more or less
    useful depending on your character concept, but always remember that every
    point you spend buying runes is coming directly out of your stats, and that
    either of these abilities can be acquired by class or discipline abilities
    or magical equipment. </p>
  <h5>Disciplines: </h5>
  <p>Once you reach 20th level, you'll have the opportunity to apply up to 3 discipline
    runestones, gaining access to additional skills and powers not normally available
    to your profession. The merits and details of specific disciplines are discussed
    elsewhere; be aware that in order to fully exploit most disciplines will require
    a substantial diversion of training points away from your profession's core
    abilities, which may or may not be to your character's advantage. Don't feel
    obligated to take three disciplines, or even one, just because you can.</p>
