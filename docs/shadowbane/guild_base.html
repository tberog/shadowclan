<!-- Updates should be placed only between Comment Tags marked as "Edit Text Begins" and "Edit Text Ends"

There are 4 levels of Text: H1 for main heading, H2 for sub-headings, H5 for cutlines and sub-sub-headings, and P for all ordinary text.

Links will automatically appear as defined by the style sheet.

Do not edit any of the DIV tags.

There are 4 DIV IDs:

1) TOP contains the image at the top of the page. This DIV does not need to be edited by page or section updaters. This DIV contains no text.

2) LEFT contains the menu in the left column. Standard HTML hyperlink rules apply. Each link is separated by the XMTL tag <br />

3) MIDDLE contains the copy for the page. Follow nomal HTML 4 rules or XMTL rules as defined by the W3C XHTML 1.0 Transitional DTD. Allowable tags are <P></P>, <H1></H1>, <H2></H2>, <H5></H5>. Please do not use non-breaking spaces to indent paragraph beginnings, all copy is flush left/ragged right.

If you insert a table into this column please do not used fixed-width table or cell setings, the MIDDLE column floats to match the width of the browser window. Do not fix a table width, but do fix cell widths at percentages of 100 (i.e., 3 columnn tables would have cell widths of 33,33,33).

Images set into the middle column should be no wider than 250 pixels in order to avoid odd behaviours. Do not insert images without optimizing them for web viewing and specifying the image's dimensions in the tag.

4) RIGHT DIV ID is for supplementalinformation, highlighting points of importance and for small images no wider than 110 pixels.

A note on IMAGES: by default only small size images appear on any full page. If there is a need for a larger image to appear, link the smaller image to the larger image and have the larger appear alone in its own browser window. the IMG tag should indicate target="blank" in order for this to work.

<h1>Shadowclan Guild Structure</h1>

<p><a href="guild_base.html">Basic Guild Structure</a> | <a href=
"arkhakts.html">Arkhakts</a> |</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Government:</h2>
 Communist/Socialist - The Clan comes above all else. Every member
works for the betterment of the <i>virakt</i>. Personal wealth is
allowed, but frowned upon. A majority, if not all, of the funds
acquired, generally go into the guild treasury and are used for the
betterment of the Clan as a whole. Clan members who seek to
accumulate excessive personal wealth are shunned and sometimes even
stripped of their money and goods and thrown naked into the desert
so that they might remember the value of community. Survival is a
group effort upon the Burning Sands. On the other side of the coin,
no guild member will ever be in need. If something is needed, just
ask your fellow clan members. Shadowclan will take care of its
own.</p>

<h2>Guild Type:</h2> Virakt - Shadowclan Virakt<br>
 Shadowclan is a gathering of many <i>Irekei</i> under one banner.
We are a 'family' of tribes who have bonded together to present a
united front against the <i>fir'khanim</i> and heretical
Irekei.</p>

<h2>Official Guild Ranks:</h2>

<div style="margin-left: 2em">
<p><b>Urikhan</b> - (Cold Blooded One)<br>
 Young Irekei who have yet to prove themselves in their Rite of Passage.<br />
 <b>Irikhan</b> - (Hot Blooded One)<br>
 Young Irekei who have completed their Rite of Passage and are
accepted as full members of the Clan.<br />
 <b>Sek'alar</b> - (Hunter; warrior of note)<br />
 Mature Irekei who have earned respect within the Clan<br />
 <b>Khal'usht</b> - (Flame Keeper; typically older Irekei who
advise leaders)<br />
 Council Members. Leaders of the Clan<br />
 <b>Arkhalar</b> - (Blade WiInner; literally "clawed one")<br />
 Shadowclan Sub-guild leaders</p>

<p><b>Khal'urvho</b> - (Phoenix; literally "Fiery bird")<br />
 <b>Khar'uus</b> - (Blood Lord; literally "Fire Master")<br />
 <b>Kryqhi'khalin</b> - (Chosen One; literally "Blessed Spawn of
the Sun")<br />
 <i>The last three titles are all reserved for the leader(s) of the
great ShadowClan Empire!</i></p>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>OUT OF GAME LEADERSHIP:<br />
 =========================</b></p>

<h2>The Clan Helm</h2>
 &nbsp; The Clan Helm members have no "real" In-Game political
power. However, in cases where the In-Game leadership decides to do
something diametrically opposed to Shadowclan ideals (extreme
example: If In-Game leaders decide to open the clan to all races
and all classes, speak only in French, and change the guild to a
Church of the All-Father), the Clan Helm could exercise a "Veto"
power. Clan Helm members have no special rank or benefits in-game.
However, their characters may become in-game leaders (except for
the Guild Leader position).</p>

<h2>Branch Leader</h2>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;The Branch Leader is the final say in all matters
concerning this branch of Shadowclan. The Branch Leader holds OOG
Veto power over any decision made by the Inner Council. Also
responsible for maintaining their in-game leadership presence.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><b>IN GAME LEADERSHIP:<br />
 ====================</b></p>

<p>An <b>Inner Council (IC)</b> will be formed
consiting of 5 members nominated and elected to these "permanent"
positions. An Inner Council member can be removed (and/or replaced)
by unanimous vote of the 4 other IC members. All 5 Inner Council
members will be given "INNER COUNCIL" level of authority. The IC
will vote by simple majority on most issues. Because of
time/risk/resources involved, a unanimous IC vote is needed to
start a siege. Unanimous IC vote also required for changing the
basic Leadership and Racial "structure" of the clan once it is
decided upon.</p>

<p>The <b>Inner Council (IC)</b> will consist of:</p>

<p><b>Guild Leader (GL) - (title based on in-game
rank):</b> This is the "Official Branch Leader"; Figurehead for the
Clan. The GL "founds" the guild in-game. He/She plants the guild
tree. The GL is the character name that will show up on the
interactive map as the "leader" of the clan. He also supports other
IC members as needed. (This person should not be an existing OOG
Clan Helm member)</p>

<p><b>City Leader (CL) - <i>Vir'habat</i> (literally
"Spawn Keeper"):</b> Oversees the intake of new members (lists,
promotions, etc.. Develops "Gruntee tests" quests, hunting trips
(if needed) etc). The CL enforces the standards for intake decided
upon by the Inner Council. CL also mobilizes older members to help
new members and is responsible for fielding proposals for building
construction and presenting them to the IC. Shares responsibility
with the RL for collecting money and maintaining the Clan
treasury.</p>

<p><b>Religious Leader (RL) - <i>Vir'usht</i>
(literally "Keeper of the Sands"):</b> The RL develops religious
and roleplay aspects of the clan and makes sure they are consistent
with the fiction of Shadowbane. The RL acts as clan historian,
recieves new group proposals and supports the Civic Leader as
needed with training and indoctrinating new members. Responsible
for religion development, ceremonies, record-keeping and promotion
of religious fervor. Shares responsibility with the CL for
collecting money (tithes) and maintaining the Clan treasury. Also
helps TL and DL with maintaining the purity of Clan thought (ie
spies).</p>

<p><b>Tactical Leader (TL) - <i>Vir'uus</i> (literally
"Master of the Sands"):</b> (may possibly require the Command
Discipline for this position) The TL is the military commander of
the clan. The TL develops the overall tactics/strategy of clan in
large battles (with input from others). The TL is in charge of city
defense (may work on KOS list with Diplomatic Leader). The TL
maintains clan arsenal and inventory of military supplies
(arms/armor/siege engines etc.). The TL works closely with the CL
to make sure that the SC city has enough appropriate shops/vendors
to keep the Clan armed and prepared. They also often work with the
DL on matters of war and spy info.</p>

<p><b>Diplomatic Leader (DL) - <i>Praklabar</i>
(literally "One who speaks"):</b> The DL is in charge of
maintaining inter-guild relations with neighbors, and is considered
the "first contact" with outside guilds with
questions/issues/negotiations. The DL maintains KOS lists for
cities and lists of current guild relations
(War/Peace/Ally/Subguild status). DL is also responsible for
keeping track of active guilds both in and out of game. May also be
required to collaborate with the Tactical Leader and Religious
Leader for info/spy purposes.</p>

<p>Note: All 5 Inner Council members cannot be members
of any particular sub-group or organization. Upon promotion to the
Council, the Council member must resign from any prior leadership
positions. No individual IC member will make final decisions on
important clan policy without an IC vote on the issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>ARKHAKT:</h2>
<p>Shadowclan is divided into several <i>Arkhakt</i>
(literally "claw-clan"), or collection of tribes, each one
representing a major faction within the Clan. Each <i>Arkhakt</i>
has one representative who sits upon the Inner Council and voices
their opinion. If there is ever a point at which Shadowclan exerts
control over multiple cities, it is likely that an
<i>Arkhalar(s)</i> from the<i>Arkhakts</i> will be appointed to
oversee the vassal city(ies).</p>

<p>Each <i>Arkhakt</i> is represented by a creature of
the desert which embodies the spirit of the <i>Arkhakt</i> and
serves as a totem to all of its members.</p>

<p>As of this time there exist three <i>Arkhakt</i>:</p>

<p><b><i>Arkhakt Arhalar'khalin</i></b> - Totem of the Serpent<br />
 <b><i>Arkhakt Jhur'ular</i></b> - Totem of the Scorpion<br />
 <b><i>Arkhakt Seva'ubar</i></b> - Totem of the Drake</p>

<p>More details on the individual Arkhakt can be found under the <a href="arkhakts.html">Arkhakt section</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>TRIBES:</h2>
<p >Typically, the Shadowclan is informally divided
along tribal lines with each of the tribes being led by an
<i>Sek'alar</i>. These <i>Sek'alar</i> often vie amongst themlseves
for respect and power, but they all realize that the Clan comes
before all else and will readily set aside their differences when
the Clan is threatened. Given the almost constant state of war with
the <i>fir'khanim</i> these days, it is rare for any Tribal
disputes to devolve into excessive bloodshed.</p>

<p >Tribes ebb and flow as the game progresses. They are
considered unofficial until such a time as they get their act
together and petition the IC for official status (requirements to
be determined later). If granted, they become an official Tribe and
their leader is given the official rank of <i>Arkhalar</i>. They
are considered in-game leaders and outrank any Irekei who is not
also a leader of a Tribe or a member of the Inner Council.</p>

<p >Each tribe may choose who they wish to allow in
their tribe.</p>

<p >Each character may only belong to one tribe at a
time. Though switching tribes is allowed, joining a tribe is
considered a serious commitment and jumping between tribes is
frowned upon. It is recommended that each player carefully consider
their choices before joining a tribe.</p>

<p >Basically, members get a concept together, write a
proposal, get approval from the <i>Arkhalar</i> of their
<i>Arkhakt</i>, forward it to the Religious Leader for approval.
The Inner Council votes on the proposal and simple majority vote
decides if the new group can "officially" form.</p>

<p ><i>So, it is possible for players to:</i><br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Form a tribe based on profession or class,<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Form a tribe based on one discipline,<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Form a tribe based on a variation of religion,<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Form a tribe of Monks,<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;Form a tribe as a specialized military unit<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are just some examples, players are encouraged
to come up with their own ideas and proposals for tribes, though
it's important to realize that, for various reasons, not all
proposals will be accepted.</p>

<p>It is also possible for tribes to grow and/or shrink
and die out...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>FAMILIES:</h2>
<p >Among Irekei, the family tie can often be the
strongest. Though family heads hold on official power, it is not
uncommon for several members of the same family to rise through the
ranks on their own merits, thus indirectly passing considerable
influence onto the family leader. Family members will usually stay
together within the same <i>Arkhakt</i> and often form tribes, but
it is not unknown for a young Irekei to desire the chance prove
themselves away from the fold.</p>

<p >&nbsp;</p>

<h2>RANK CHART:</h2>
<p >Guild Leader (title based upon status of SC cities)
- figurehead of the Clan; veto power over council<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
 Inner Council (<i>Kal'usht</i>) - Decision makers<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
 Arkhakt leaders (<i>Arkhalar</i>) - Sub-guild leaders; voice on
the council<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
 Tribe leaders (<i>Sek'alar</i>) - Day to day leaders; usually
tribal leaders though not always<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
 <i>Irikhan</i> - Rank and file of the virakt<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|<br />
 <i>Urikhan</i> - Irekei who have yet to pass their Rite of
Passage</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><h2>Diplomatic Relations:</h2></p>

<p>Deep within the heart of the Burning Desert lies the legendary city of <i>Nkuru</i>, home of the Shadowclan. <i>Fir'khanim</i> are
almost never allowed to set foot within its walls, and few non-Clan <i>Irekei</i> are allowed the honor of visiting.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Shadowclan does not hand out alliances. We have yet to meet other <i>Virakts</i> that were worthy of such an esteemed gift, and the <i>fir'khanim</i> are only good as thralls to our great empire. This is not to say that Shadowclan will not form any alliances, but when we do, it is a sacred trust and honor bestowed upon those lucky enough to be granted such a relationship. An Irekei's word to another Irekei is sacred.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h2>Sub-Guilds, Vassals and Allies:</h2>

<p></p>

<div style="margin-left: 2em"><i>Sub-Guilds</i>: Guilds pledged to the Shadowclan guild that are formed from within Shadowclan.
<blockquote>Sub-guilds are subject to the same rules as the main Shadowclan guild and are considered part of the Clan, receiving whatever benefits and preferred treatment that brings. Allowed access to the Forbidden City.</blockquote>

<p><i>Vassals</i>: Guilds pledged to Shadowclan or one of its sub-guilds that were <b>not</b> formed within Shadowclan.<br>
<blockquote>Vassals are not subject to the same rules as Shadowclan guilds. Rules and benefits for each will likely be decided on an individual basis. Considered a 'lesser' part of the Clan and may be subject to heavy taxation. May be exiled from the Clan for inappropriate behaviour and/or bringing dishonour upon the Clan.</blockquote>

<p></p>


<p><i>Allies</i>: Guilds that are working with Shadowclan towards a common goal
<blockquote>Allies will most likely be few and far between, as the Clan is very suspicious of outsiders who are not under Clan rule. Relations with allies will be decided on an individual basis</blockquote>
