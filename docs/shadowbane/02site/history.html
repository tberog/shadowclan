		  Though emboldened, we were still to be tested. By the Desert, the Sun,

	  <td ALIGN=CENTER><span class="txt">In the Before Time, we were lost and 
		soulless. Cold to the touch and without will. It was the Time of Darkness. 
		The Unfinished Ones, the ancestors of our people, were soft and deluded. 
		Trapped by ignorance in the cold, bleak world. But the Terror arose, and 
		Darivastor, the first to see, discovered new wisdom. For here was a force 
		mightier than all else arrayed against it. With the kindling of the Sun 
		began the Time of Embers. We stayed upon the Burning Sands beneath eternal 
		light and blessed heat, and we endured. We worshipped the Great Dragon, 
		and from its restless slumbering dreams our first Blood Prophets were 
		born, heralding visions of a time when the Dragon would awake and only 
		the worthy would be spared. And through them the Phoenix Goddess was stirred 
		to action. She taught us much and we came to call the deserts home. Then 
		came The Change, when the first day was ended and the flow of time begun. 
		The Meddling God attempted to hide the Lady of the Sun from us, but our 
		heroes fought against his designs, causing the cycle of days and nights 
		that shall continue until the end. At long last, our time of seeking for 
		our true selves was brought to an end by Jall’kroda, the Blood Lord. <i>Khalikryst</i> 
		was freed from her bonds and descended upon our people with the Transforming 
		Flame. Thus was our <i>khar'ika</i> ignited, never to be quenched and 
		thus were our people born. This began the Time of Flames. Yet another 
		testing for the <i>Irekei.</i> The Hateful Ones attacked us with much 
		fury, fearful of the power we had and afraid of our attempts to rouse 
		the Dragon. Though they could not hope to match the skill and fierceness 
		of the <i>Irekei</i>, the Hateful Ones were numerous, and our people began 
		to be driven back. But, it was the Dragon who saved us again, whispering 
		secrets into the head of <i>P’reklabhar</i> and telling her of the ways 
		of the Chaos Gate. Through great magical ceremonies, she opened the gate, 
		unleashing the Hordes upon our enemies. The Horde passed us by in gratitude 
		for the favors we had done, and our people retired to the deeps of the 
		deserts to replenish our strength. It was apparent that the time for the 
		Awakening had not yet arrived.
		<p>Once, long ago, our people were as one. But as we became accustomed 
		  to our new selves and grew in numbers and power, our people began warring 
		  amongst themselves. The weak-willed <i>fir'khanim</i> would have fallen 
		  before us as quickly as the shifting sand had we the unity of old. We 
		  fought ourselves as much as the outsiders. But then, The Dragon stirred, 
		  breaking this world into scattered pieces. Our time of destiny is nigh. 
		  We must prove ourselves strong in order to burn for eternity within 
		  the Dragon itself. It is time for the wars against the <i>fir'khanim</i> 
		  to intensify, and for blood to spill upon the ground. The banner of 
		  the Shadowclan shall lead the way. The other <i>virakt</i> will join 
		  in or face extermination. Now is not the time to coddle the weak-willed 
		  or hesitate in our actions. The Dragon demands strength and fortitude. 
		  Any who cannot meet these requirements will find their <i>khar'ika</i> 
		  extinguished forever and forgotten.
