		<p><span class="txt"><br>
		  What we lack in strength, we make up for in cunning. What we lack in 
		  cunning, we make up for in knowledge. What we lack in knowledge, we 
		  make up for in strength. We are vicious, warlike and considered savages 
		  by many of the peoples of the world. <i>Skah</i>! Do they not know the 
		  joy of defeating your enemies and smelling the burning of their cities? 
		  They are nothing but <i>fir'khanim</i>, weak and soulless. Cold to the 
		  touch as if they were already dead. We roam free over the sands, and 
		  the blood runs hot in our veins. We are the Shadowclan, emboldened by 
		  the first of the Great Signs and bound to the Sands, the Sun and the 
		  Dragon. Our inner fires will sustain us and help us to cleanse the world 
		  of all who are unworthy.</span></p>
		<p></p>
<p><span class="txt">We call the deserts our home, for to live in the Greenlands is 
  to make oneself soft and weak, as the fir'khanim. Young Irekei are tested from 
  birth. Those who are not strong and quick enough to be worthy of The Dragon 
  are left to the mercies of the wastelands. Pillaging and scavenging are part 
  of every Irekei's life. The desert is a harsh teacher where few can survive 
  without proper equipment. We have learned to make do with what we can gather 
  from the land and from those who are weaker. To be called 'soft' is a great 
  insult in Irekei culture, for it implies that the Irekei in question has taken 
  on undesirable traits from the <i>fir'khanim</i>.
<p>
		To betray your Clan is to betray yourself. To be cast from the Clan is 
		the worst punishment imaginable to any Irekei. Such outcasts are known 
		as <i>vrek</i>, and their<i> khar'ika</i> is dimmed; marked for any Irekei 
		to see. They are shunned by all <i>virakt</i> and inevitably end up committing 
		themselves to the Dragon deep within the Burning Sands. No markers are 
		erected for them, and the scouring <i>Skath</i>, the fearsome desert wind, 
		quickly reduces their bones to dust. 
		<p> The desert <b>is</b> the Irekei. Its resources are ours. Its sands 
		  are ours. These are the testing grounds of our children, that they might 
		  live or die by the desert’s tests of strength and will. The desert is 
		  not for the <i>fir’khanim</i>, except to moisten with their blood. These 
		  lands are holy to us. We will allow no <i>fir’khanim</i> to gain a foothold 
		  in the desert, or even to walk upon the sands without our permission. 
		<p>It is rumored that the Shadowclan keeps a 'Forbidden City' deep within 
		  the desert where <i>fir'khanim</i> are never allowed, it's true name 
		  never uttered where outsiders might overhear. Supposedly, some of the 
		  greatest works of Irekei artisans can be found there in the form of 
		  great murals and shrines to the Dragon. Similarly, it is only there 
		  that many secret Irekei arts and skills are taught.

<td ALIGN=LEFT><span class="txt"><b>DUELS:</b><br>
		Duels are a common way of settling disputes among Irekei. The Way of the 
		Challenge varies from virakt to virakt and many tribes and families have 
		their own customs as well. But the aspects of the duels are always the 
		same. They are always fought in the heat of the day, beneath the Blessed 
		Sun, either upon the Sands themselves or within a Temple. The duels are 
		fought with knives, for every Irekei learns the art of the knife from 
		the day they are born. Though Blood Duels are always fought to the death, 
		Irekei understand the value of their respected kin, and oftentimes lesser 
		duels are merely fought until first blood.</span></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT><span class="txt"><b>KHAN'JALLAKAR:</b><br> 
  Any war upon another <i>Virakt</i> shall be openly declared before 
	any serious hostilities commence. Such is the way of our people. The <i>fir'khanim</i>, 
	however, are not worthy of such respect.
  <p>Though not all follow it's path, within every Irekei beats a 
	Warrior's heart. Deception, deceit and trickery are tools to be used against 
	the <i>fir'khanim</i>. When you are fighting your brethren, stand tall and 
	proud.</span></td>

		<p><b><span class="txt">RETURNING TO THE SANDS:</span></b><span class="txt"><br>
		  <span class="txt">Given the nature of Irekei life, most of our people 
		  do not live to what would be considered old age. Those that do are often 
		  respected and venerated as they have proved themselves worthy through 
		  many generations. But, no Irekei wishes to die in their bed, and there 
		  comes a time when an ancient Irekei might consider themselves of no 
		  more use to the Clan. At such a point, they divest themselves of all 
		  belongings save a small knife and the clothes upon their back (and sometimes 
		  not even that). Relieved of the burden of wealth and responsibility, 
		  they walk out alone into the Deep Desert, never to be seen again. Such 
		  Irekei are much honored in tales and song and they are said to have 
		  'Returned to the Sands'.</span></span></p>
		<p><span class="txt"><span class="txt">This custom continues to this day, 
		  despite the effects of the Great Stirring of the Dragon. Many Irekei 
		  philosophers and prophets say that those who never return to the Tree 
		  of the Dragon have their spirits plucked from the ether by the Terror 
		  of Terrors. Those that are worthy are consumed to forever be a part 
		  of <i>Kryquo'Khalin</i> while the others are cast into the Great Void.</span></span></p>
