		as a whole. Clan members who seek to accumulate excessive personal wealth 
		are shunned and sometimes even stripped of their money and goods and thrown 
		naked into the desert so that they might remember the value of community. 
		Survival is a group effort upon the Burning Sands. On the other side of 
		the coin, no guild member will ever be in need. If something is needed, 
		just ask your fellow clan members. Shadowclan will take care of its own. 
		<p> For in-game purposes, <i>Oligarchy</i> will likely be the government

		<p class="txt"><b>OUT OF GAME LEADERSHIP:<br>
		  =========================</b></p>
		<p class="txt"><b> The Clan Helm</b> <br>
		  &nbsp; The Clan Helm members have no "real" In-Game political power. 
		  However, in cases where the In-Game leadership decides to do something 
		  diametrically opposed to Shadowclan ideals (extreme example: If In-Game 
		  leaders decide to open the clan to all races and all classes, speak 
		  only in French, and change the guild to a Church of the All-Father), 
		  the Clan Helm could exercise a "Veto" power. Clan Helm members have 
		  no special rank or benefits in-game. However, their characters may become 
		  in-game leaders (except for the Guild Leader position).</p>
		<p class="txt"><b>Branch Leader</b><br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;The Branch Leader is the final say in all matters concerning 
		  this branch of Shadowclan. The Branch Leader holds OOG Veto power over 
		  an decision made by the Elder Council. Also responsible for maintaining 
		  their in-game leadership presence.</p>
		<p class="txt"> <br>
		</p>
		<p class="txt"><b> IN GAME LEADERSHIP:<br>
		  ====================</b></p>
		<p class="txt">An <b>Elder Council (EC)</b> will be formed consiting of 
		  5 members nominated and elected to these "permanent" positions. An Elder 
		  Council member can be removed (and/or replaced) by unanimous vote of 
		  the 4 other EC members. All 5 Elder Council members will be given "INNER 
		  COUNCIL" level of authority. (basically access to most of the same commands 
		  as the guild leader according to the FAQ). The EC will vote by simple 
		  majority on most issues. Because of time/risk/resources involved, a 
		  unanimous EC vote is needed to start a siege. Unanimous EC vote also 
		  required for changing the basic Leadership and Racial "structure" of 
		  the clan once it is decided upon. </p>
		<p class="txt">The <b>Elder Council (EC)</b> will consist of:</p>
		<p class="txt"> <b>Guild Leader (GL) - (title based on in-game rank):</b> 
		  This is the "Official Branch Leader"; Figurehead for the Clan. The GL 
		  "founds" the guild in-game. He/She plants the guild tree. The GL is 
		  the character name that will show up on the interactive map as the "leader" 
		  of the clan. He also supports other EC members as needed. (This person 
		  should not be an existing OOG Clan Helm member)</p>
		<p class="txt"><b>Civic Leader (CL) - <i>Qhi'usht</i> (literally "Spawn 
		  Keeper"):</b> Oversees the intake of new members (lists, promotions, 
		  etc.. Develops "Gruntee tests" quests, hunting trips (if needed) etc). 
		  The CL enforces the standards for intake decided upon by the Elder Council. 
		  CL also mobilizes older members to help new members and is responsible 
		  for fielding proposals for building construction and presenting them 
		  to the EC. Shares responsibility with the RL for collecting money and 
		  maintaining the Clan treasury.</p>
		<p class="txt"> <b>Religious Leader (RL) - <i>Vir'usht</i> (literally 
		  "Keeper of the Sands"):</b> The RL develops religious and roleplay aspects 
		  of the clan and makes sure they are consistent with the fiction of Shadowbane. 
		  The RL acts as clan historian, recieves new group proposals and supports 
		  the Civic Leader as needed with training and indoctrinating new members. 
		  Responsible for religion development, ceremonies, record-keeping and 
		  promotion of religious fervor. Shares responsibility with the CL for 
		  collecting money (tithes) and maintaining the Clan treasury. Also helps 
		  TL and DL with maintaining the purity of Clan thought (ie spies).</p>
		<p class="txt"> <b>Tactical Leader (TL) - <i>Vir'uus</i> (literally "Master 
		  of the Sands"):</b> (may possibly require the Command Discipline for 
		  this position) The TL is the military commander of the clan. The TL 
		  develops the overall tactics/strategy of clan in large battles (with 
		  input from others). The TL is in charge of city defense (may work on 
		  KOS list with Diplomatic Leader). The TL maintains clan arsenal and 
		  inventory of military supplies (arms/armor/siege engines etc.). The 
		  TL works closely with the CL to make sure that the SC city has enough 
		  appropriate shops/vendors to keep the Clan armed and prepared. They 
		  also often work with the DL on matters of war and spy info.</p>
		<p class="txt"><b> Diplomatic Leader (DL) - <i>Uri'ubar</i> (literally 
		  "Cold Hand"):</b> The DL is in charge of maintaining inter-guild relations 
		  with neighbors, and is considered the "first contact" with outside guilds 
		  with questions/issues/negotiations. The DL maintains KOS lists for cities 
		  and lists of current guild relations (War/Peace/Ally/Subguild status). 
		  DL is also responsible for keeping track of active guilds both in and 
		  out of game. May also be required to collaborate with the Tactical Leader 
		  and Religious Leader for info/spy purposes.</p>
		<p class="txt">Note: All 5 Elder Council members cannot be members of 
		  any particular tribe/family/"bludline" group or organization. Upon promotion 
		  to the Council, the Council member must resign from any prior leadership 
		  positions. No individual EC member will make final decisions on important 
		  clan policy without an EC vote on the issue.</p>
		<p class="txt">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="txt"><b class="txt">ARKHAKT:<br>
		  =========</b></p>
		<p class="txt">Shadowclan is divided into several <i>Arkhakt</i> (literally 
          &quot;claw-clan&quot;), or collection of tribes, each one representing 
          a major faction within the Clan. Each <i>Arkhakt</i> has one representative 
          who sits upon the Elder Council and voices their opinion. They still 
          do not have an official vote on Council matters, but, often just having 
          the ears of the Council Members can mean much influence. The <i>Arkhakt</i> 
          are controlled by <i>Troni'bhor</i> (rising family) who are the leaders. 
          If there is ever a point at which Shadowclan exerts control over multiple 
          cities, it is likely that an <i>Arkhalar(s)</i> from an <i>Arkhakt</i> 
          will be appointed to oversee the vassal city(ies).</p>
		<p class="txt">Each <i>Arkhakt</i> is represented by a creature of the 
		  desert which embodies the spirit of the <i>Arkhakt</i> and serves as 
		  a totem to all of its members.</p>
		<p class="txt">At the moment there are three <i>Arkhakts</i>:</p>
		<p class="txt"><b><i>Qhi'nkur</i></b> - Totem of the Drake<br>
		  <i><b>Jhur'ular</b></i> - Totem of the Scorpion<br>
          <i><b>Vir'jhal</b></i> - Totem of the Serpent</p>
		<p class="txt">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="txt"> <b class="txt">TRIBES:<br>
		  =======</b></p>
		<p class="txt">Typically, the Shadowclan is informally divided along tribal 
		  or famliy lines with each of these 'tribes' being led by an <i>Arkhalar</i>. 
		  These <i>Arkhalars</i> often vie amongst themlseves for respect and 
		  power, but they all realize that the Clan comes before all else and 
		  will readily set aside their differences when the Clan is threatened. 
		  Given the almost constant state of war with the <i>fir'khanim</i> these 
		  days, it is rare for any Tribal disputes to devolve into excessive bloodshed.</p>
		<p class="txt">Tribes ebb and flow as the game progresses. They are considered 
		  unofficial until such a time as they get their act together and petition 
		  the EC for official status (requirements to be determined later). If 
		  granted, they become an official Tribe and their leader is given the 
		  official rank of <i>Arkhalar</i>. They are considered in-game leaders 
		  and outrank any Irekei who is not also a leader of a Tribe or a member 
		  of the Inner Council.</p>
		<p class="txt">Each tribe may choose who they wish to allow in their tribe.</p>
		<p class="txt">Each character may only belong to one tribe at a time. 
		  Though switching tribes is allowed, joining a tribe is considered a 
		  serious commitment and jumping between tribes is frowned upon. It is 
		  recommended that each player carefully consider their choices before 
		  joining a tribe.</p>
		<p class="txt">Basically, members get a concept together, write a proposal, 
		  get approval from the <i>Arkhalar</i> of their <i>Arkhakt</i>, forward 
		  it to the Religious Leader for approval. The Elder Council votes on 
		  the proposal and simple majority vote decides if the new group can "officially" 
		  form.</p>
		<p class="txt"><i>So, it is possible for players to:</i><br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;Form a tribe based on profession or class,<br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;Form a tribe based on one discipline,<br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;Form a tribe based on a variation of religion,<br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;Form a tribe of Monks,<br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;Form a tribe that becomes a sub-guild,<br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;Form a tribe as a specialized military unit<br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="txt">These are just some examples, players are encouraged to 
		  come up with their own ideas and proposals for tribes, though it's important 
		  to realize that, for various reasons, not all proposals will be accepted.<br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="txt">It is also possible for tribes to grow and/or shrink and 
		  die out...</p>
		<p class="txt">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="txt"> <b class="txt">FAMILIES:<br>
		  =========</b></p>
		<p class="txt">Families.. Among Irekei, the family tie can often be the 
		  strongest. Each <i>Arkhakt</i> is led by a single family. Family members 
		  will usually stay together withing the same <i>Arkhakt</i> and often 
		  form tribes, but it is not unknown for a young Irekei to desire to prove 
		  themselves away from the fold.</p>
