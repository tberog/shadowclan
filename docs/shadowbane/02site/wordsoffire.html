<h2>Words of Fire, Words of Ash</h2>
  <i class="txt">As Spoken by Ahri</i> 
</center>
<p><span class="txt">As the Flame burns and the Sun burns, so must we. To do less 
  is to die. Our blood must course through us like tounges of flame, our souls 
  must burn bright and me must speak with words of fire. We must burn away the 
  prison of flesh that even yet encloses even the most radiant of us and bare 
  our soul to the Scourge of Scourges. This is known. </span></p>
<p><span class="txt"> Yet how many have let their blood cool, how many have let 
  their souls grow dim, and how many have spoken words of ash? They number ten 
  thousand ten thousand and the dust of their foolishness lays heavy upon us.</span>
<p><span class="txt"> There are some that say that by strengthening their bodies 
  they brighten their <i>khar'ika</i>. Some say that by using lumps of their own 
  meat to make the <i>fir'khanim</i> rain blood they burn brighter those that 
  use lumps of metal to make the <i>fir'khanim</i> rain blood. What fools are 
  these! Are not Half-Giants stronger than even the strongest of them? May Half-Giants 
  be exalted above these fools and may their bodies be burned to ash by the Source 
  of the Sun, for they speak words of ash.</span>
<p><span class="txt">There are some that say that by embracing obediance they 
  brighten their <i>khar'ika</i>. Some make themselves <i>jov'uus</i> to the least 
  mutterings of the least of the <i>Khanarch’alarl</i>. What fools are these! 
  Are not the Living Stones more obediant than even the most dedicated of them? 
  May the Living Stones be exalted above these fools and may their souls never 
  never know the freedom that Wisdom brings, for they speak words of ash.</span>
<p><span class="txt">There are some that say that by mastering the Art they brighten 
  their <i>khar'ika</i>. Some say that they are capable of untangling the net 
  that the Meddling God has caught us in with their art! What fools are these! 
  Are not the Hateful Ones of old more Gifted than even the greatest of them? 
  May the Hateful Ones be exalted above these fools and may their foolish mutterings 
  be silences at their tounges are burned to ash by the <i>KryKhalin</i>, for 
  they speak words of ash.</span>
<p><span class="txt">There are some that say that the destruction of meat brightens 
  their <i>khar'ika</i>. Some say that the splattering of the blood that flows 
  like rain shall quench the wrath of the Dragon! What fools are these! Does the 
  Plague kill more than even the bloodiest of them? May the Plague be exalted 
  above these fools and they drown in the blood they shed, for they speak words 
  of ash.</span>
<p><span class="txt">We must quiet these foolish words of ash and let words of 
  fire burn away their idiocy. The flame of our voices shall rise up to the sun 
  and sink down to the Lair. But what are the words of fire?</span>
<p><span class="txt">Let us contemplate what separates the Source of the Sun from 
  the Meddling God, what separates the Lady of the Sun from the Hunter, what separates 
  the <i>Irekei</i> from the <i>fir'khanim</i>. The Terror of Terrors crafted 
  souls to burn as bright reflections of his glory, the Meddling God fashioned 
  prisons of flesh to quench the burning of our souls. The Dragon wed the bright 
  burning of the sun, the Meddling God wed the dead rock of the Moon. The Dragon's 
  people are those whose prisons of flesh grow thin enough to let their souls 
  blaze, the Meddling God's people are those who glory in the finely-crafted chains 
  that make them <i>jov'uus</i>.</span>
<p><span class="txt">Thus the words of fire are those that burn us away from the 
  putrid dampness of flesh and towards the blazing glory of our souls. We must 
  speak words of fire that shall allow us to cast away the strength of our bodies, 
  the strength of our minds, the strengths of our wills and blaze with a glory 
  that turns the fetters of reality to dust. In casting away the strength of our 
  bodies we shall bring a half giants to screaming to his knees with the merest 
  touch, in casting away the strength of the mind we shall be deaftened by the 
  Hateful ones gasping at the extent of our knowledge, and in casting away strength 
  of will we shall burn away our chains and blaze as reflections of the sublimity 
  of the Scourge of Scourges! For there is nothing good in this world of flesh 
  and there is nothing of worth ourside of <i>khar'ika</i>.</span>
<p><span class="txt">All glory to the Terror of Terrors, may he hear our Words 
  of Fire!</span>
