		  </font> 
		  <p> The Outcasts, Devil Men of the Burning Wastes
		  <p> The "Devilmen," little is known of these strange, fierce, red-skinned 
			raiders of the desert. Folktales claim they are the descendants of 
			a long lost family of Elvish nobles who were banished to the Burning 
			Lands for their ferocity and warlike nature. While Irekei and Elves 
			are distinctly similar, the Devilmen deny any kinship, and respond 
			to the suggestion with violence. Known primarily for their ferocity 
			in battle and their ruthless treatment of all non-Irekei, raiding 
			parties of Irekei are the terror of all settlements that border on 
			the deserts. Renowned for their teachings in the mystic arts, Irekei 
			also make cunning assassins. It is said that Irekei children are trained 
			in the use of knives from birth, and learn to fight before they learn 
			to speak. What outsiders see as cruelty, Irekei see as strength tempered 
			by grim necessity. The crucible of the desert has turned the Devilmen 
			into a grim, hard people for whom survival is the ultimate priority.

		<p><i>Irekei</i> are a proud people, warlike and suspicious of all outsiders. 
		  Bonds to family and clan are strong and often the defining point for 
		  many <i>Virakts</i>. <i>Irekei</i> have proven themselves through generations 
		  upon the Anvil of the Sun, and this causes them to view the lesser races 
		  with much disdain. Fraternization with other races is viewed with much 
		  suspicion and those who do so are viewed with mistrust.</p>

		<p class="txt"><b>On The Specialty Classes Not Available to Irekei:</b>
		<blockquote class="txt"> 
		  <p> <b>Barbarians</b><br>
			Crude warriors from the cold Northlands. They have no internal fire 
			and live only for battle.</p>
		  <p> <b>Crusaders, Templars, Confessors, Prelates and Priests<br>
			</b>These are worshippers of the All-Father, ancient enemy of the 
			Dragon. Irekei sing praises to The Great Dragon whose blood flows 
			through the world. Worship of the All-Father is a certain death sentence 
			in most Irekei towns.</p>
		  <p> <b>Warlocks</b><br>
			Freaks of nature created at the Sundering, Warlocks are not to be 
			tolerated. Only the Humans, Shades and Aelfborn are weak enough to 
			be afflicted by this strange, new madness.</p>
		  <p> <b> Druids and Rangers</b> <br>
			Worshippers of Braialla. They are as soft and fragile as the Greenlands 
			they covet. The Turning of the Dragon has broken their Green Mother 
			much as they shall be broken themselves. The Burning Sands are no 
			place for such as these.</p>
		  <p> <b>Healers</b><br>
			Our lives are a constant test. We must prove ourselves worthy. Those 
			who need tending for every little scratch do not show the strength 
			and fortitude that will be needed when the Dragon awakes.</p>
		  <p> <b>Huntress, Fury</b><br>
			Amazons. Female witches and warriors from the Steaming Greenlands. 
			Irekei females would never submit to being part of such a culture. 
			The Furies claim to be able to tame weather, though we know that none 
			of them shall ever master the Sands.</p>

		<p><b>On the Irekei Specialty Classes:</b> 
		<p> (also see <a href="./join.html">Joining and Character Creation</a>) 
		<blockquote class="txt"> 
		  <p><b>Assassin</b><br>
			Irekei respect those who can kill quickly and efficiently. Wasteful 
			movement means death upon the Burning Sands. Every young Irekei learns 
			economy of movement. Patience and knowing when to strike and how to 
			strike quickly so that the battle is not drawn out are important abilities 
			in any Irekei's life. These traits lend themselves well to the art 
			of assasination, so it is unsurprising to find many young Irekei following 
			this path.<br>
			(Base Class: Mage and Rogue)</p>
		  <p> <b>Bard</b><br>
			Bards provide us with song, poetry and merriment. They are the keepers 
			of our history and lore. As people the desert forces us to gather 
			our strength and express our passions.<br>
			(Base Class: Mage and Rogue)</p>
		  <p> <b>Channeler</b><br>
			Channellers speak to the prime elements commanding earth, air, fire 
			and ice. The raw power they can command is unequaled among the mages, 
			and this is both a blessing and a curse. Many a proud Channeler have 
			destroyed themselves by attempting to wield more of the vital forces 
			of the world than they could handle. This constant element of uncertainty 
			tends to shape these Irekei. Some become overly cautious, never reaching 
			their full potential for fear of backlash, while others continually 
			test their limits, summoning as much power as they are able while 
			laughing in the face of imminent death.<br>
			(Base Class: Mage)</p>
		  <p> <b>Scout</b><br>
			Moving as quickly as the wind and as silently as the desert mouse. 
			Irekei scouts range far and wide, searching for signs of intrusion 
			into the Burning Desert and scouting out <i>fhir'khanim</i> settlements 
			for raids. An Irekei scout's work is never done, and many young Irekei 
			choose this life of adventure, where the chase is always on.<br>
			(Base Class: Rogue)</p>
		  <p> <b>Thief</b><br>
			To steal from your own <i>virakt</i> is inconcievable to most Irekei. 
			The Sands have little patience for those who betray their people for 
			personal gain. A slow death is too good for this kind. As for the 
			<i>fir'khanim</i>, it is often better to kill them and take their 
			things than to tolerate the presence of thieves. Those Rogues who 
			steer their lives towards combat, rather than theft, often find their 
			skills readily transferrable to the battlefield, and their successes 
			praised as much as any Warrior's.<br>
			(Base Class: Rogue)</p>
		  <p> <b>Warrior</b><br>
			Every Irekei is a fighter at heart. Those who choose to devote their 
			lives to the art of combat are well respected and often chosen to 
			lead the armies. Raids and warfare with the Irydnu and other <i>fir'khanim</i> 
			have gone on for centuries. These neighbors of ours corrupt the desert, 
			pollute our springs and slay our prey. Early on we learned of the 
			need for strong and hard Irekei to push back their encroachment upon 
			our borders. The warriors sacrifice themselves for the survival of 
			our people. Their <i>khar'ika</i> burns bright.<br>
			(Base Class: Fighter)</p>
		  <p> <b>Wizard</b><br>
			Pure Mages, devoted to a lifetime of magical study. The magi slaves 
			over ancient texts, preserving the knowledge we have over the manipulation 
			of all things magical. They have swayed battles and as such are valued 
			for their service to the people, but some have also been known to 
			forsake the basic necessities of survival, forsaking their body and 
			having their skin color degenerate nearly to the paleness of <i>fir'khanim</i>. 
			Such things are not taken lightly by any Irekei.<br>
			(Base Class: Mage)</p>

		<blockquote class="txt"> 
		  <p> <B>Werebear, Wererat and Werewolf - shunned:<BR>
			</B>These are taints of the humans and those related to them. We are 
			above such beastiality. Only pure Irekei blood flows through our veins. 
			The inner fires would not permit such a brutish co-mingling of vital 
			fluids. </p>
		  <p> <B>Blade Weaver and Blade Master - scorned:<BR>
			</B>These 'dances' are not the Irekei way. Combat is quick and violent. 
			It is not the time to mince swords. Those who practice these 'arts' 
			will not be so quick to dance once they find an Irekei blade in their 
			ribs.</p>
		  <p> <B>Forge Master, Giant Killer - tolerated:<BR>
			</B>These secrets are only known by the Dwarven people. Though the 
			Men of Stone are strange to us and have little like for our people, 
			we respect their ability to craft fine weapons and their uncanny knack 
			for slaying the Tall Ones.</p>
		  <p> <B>Wrymslayer - despised:<BR>
			</B>Our patron Lord is The Great Dragon, thus we don't seek out ways 
			to slay his children. Any that do are despised by the Irekei. Those 
			who choose to make a career of such blaphemous acts are often slain 
			on sight by angry Irekei raiding parties.</p>
		  <p> <B>Knight and Dark Knight - scorned:<BR>
			</B>More rules revealing the frailties of the humans. We are bound 
			through our toils and upbringing. We do not need a set of codes to 
			tell us who we are.</p>
		  <p> <B>Berserker - scorned:<BR>
			</B>Savage beasts. These kind are no more a Warrior than the wolves 
			that roam the Greenlands. Gripped by their insanity and rejecting 
			the yoke of the <I>jov'uss</I>, the Berserkers can only be put down 
			as any wild beast thast refuses to recognize its rightful master.</p>

		<p class="txt"> (also see <a href="./join.html">Joining and Character 
		  Creation</a>) 
		<blockquote class="txt"> 
		  <p><B>Alchemist - revered</B><BR>
			Masters of the vital fluids, Alchemists fashion potions and salves 
			to mimick and aid the power of the <I>khar'ika</I>. They work with 
			the inner fires, bolstering their heat and quickening their abilities. 
			Any who have such intimate knowledge of the inner fires are well-respected 
			in Irekei culture. </p>
		  <p> <B>Animator - scorned but tolerated</B><br>
			This is a Lesser Art, held sacred by Men and Dwarves for they themselves 
			are but animations created by their gods. Any true being burns with 
			its own fire. </p>
		  <p> <B>Archer - respected</B><BR>
			A keen eye with the bow is not always easy in the blowing winds and 
			the shifting sands. Those who devote their skills to the bow, are 
			often at the forefront of city defense and an invaluable aid during 
			any battle. </p>
		  <p> <B>Black Mask - mistrusted but tolerated</B><BR>
			They teach well the work of the assassin, deception of the <I>fir'khanim</I>, 
			and the deadly use of the blade, but they demand a loyalty they can 
			never truly have from an Irekei. We use them as we see fit, and parrot 
			back their phrases with an appearance of sincerity that they cannot 
			see through, choosing the contracts which benefit the clan. Irekei 
			must take the utmost care in infiltration, however, as clever the 
			tongue and convincing the appearance, a touch of our flesh is all 
			that is required to reveal us. Following the Black Mask is solitary 
			work, involving a casual toying with loyalties and appearances, and 
			Irekei who attempt this path are viewed with mistrust by many. </p>
		  <p> <B>Blacksmith - deeply respected</B><BR>
			The forgers of the blades we value so highly, their work is sacred. 
			For it is the Blacksmith who forges the very claws we use to rend 
			and destroy the All-Father and his deluded followers. </p>
		  <p> <B>Blood Prophet (Khanarch&#8217;alar) - revered (Irekei only)</B><BR>
			Chosen of the Dragon. Mystical masters of the <I>Kharikryst</I>, the 
			Magic Fire. The voice of the Dragon whispers within their heads and 
			their words and guidance are always viewed with respect. </p>
		  <p> <B>Bounty Hunter - tolerated</B><BR>
			Hunting <I>fir'khanim</I> for money seems a bizarre past time, although 
			perhaps satisfying to some, they are after all put on this world to 
			prey upon. Employing those techniques towards capturing <I>jov'uus</I> 
			for the Clan in battles against the enemy, or getting at their leaders, 
			that is at least an honorable path. Occasionally, the Bounty Hunters 
			are called to chase down a traitor who has fled from their rightful 
			punishment. The leaders of the <I>virakt</I> put a high price on their 
			heads and the Bounty Hunters respond. The honour of their Clan is 
			generally more motivation than any reward. </p>
		  <p> <B>Commander - well respected</B><BR>
			Our leaders are valued and respected, if their <I>khar'ika</I> continues 
			to burn. It is obvious, it is the way of things. Those who can lead 
			us to victory are placed in high esteem. </p>
		  <p> <B>Duelist - well respected</B><BR>
			Mastery of the blade, and testing one's strength and fire against 
			another, these are ways well known to our people. </p>
		  <p> <B>Gladiator - scorned but tolerated</B><BR>
			While many warriors choose to look down on those who fight for amusement 
			and deem them unworthy of the Dragon, this has not stopped the Arena 
			from filling with excited and adoring fans who cheer the arrival of 
			their favorite combatant. There may be things to be learned from such 
			activities, but it seems a frivolous and wasteful pursuit. Show us 
			something of value we did not know before. The crowd knows nothing 
			of real combat, they only cheer at the sight of blood; hopefully it 
			is not your own. </p>
		  <p> <B>Huntsman - respected</B><BR>
			Hah! Listen to the <I>fir'khanim</I> prattle on about centaurs and 
			Greenlands - then let those fools try and hunt in the burning desert, 
			where the creatures do not even allow the sun to find them. As they 
			die, their fragile skins roasting in the relentless sun, then will 
			they understand what skill a true hunter must have. The wastelands 
			are our home. And here, there is no truer test for a huntsman. </p>
		  <p> <B>Rat Catcher - scorned</B><BR>
			You wish to spend your time in the bowels of the cities? Are you mad? 
			The tunnels are no place for a warrior. Clean, desert air and an uninterrupted 
			view of the horizon to keep an eye on your enemies is what is needed. 
			Those who spend their time in the depths of the earth shall miss out 
			on the true pleasures of life. </p>
		  <p> <B>Rune Caster - respected but distrusted</B><BR>
			Here we turn the very words of the All-Father against him. It is said 
			he shaped the world with these runes, but we turn them to the destruction 
			of his followers and his precious creations. Here is the true and 
			final evidence that his powers are as playthings to the eternal Dragon. 
		  </p>
		  <p> <B>Sorcerer - respected</B><BR>
			A valuable occupation, used to further the goals of the clan. Enchanters 
			of blade and armour. These mages wield the Dragon Fire, imbuing items 
			with its magic. Many Sorcerors are deeply religious, and it is their 
			goods that are valued above all others. </p>
		  <p> <B>Summoner - respected</B><BR>
			Caller of Beasts. Though the desert seems empty, there is much more 
			here than meets the eye. Those creatures that can survive on the Burning 
			Sands, are apt to be more powerful and cunning than anything in the 
			Greenlands. This is often a discipline of Rangers and Huntresses, 
			for it is good to have friends when you are alone upon the Sands. 
		  </p>
		  <p> <B>Sun Dancer - revered (Irekei only) </B><BR>
			Masters of themselves and their<I> khar'ika</I>, the legendary feats 
			of the Sun Dancers are whispered across the world. Often aloof from 
			<I>virakt</I> politics, the <I>khar'ika</I> of the Sun Dancers burns 
			brightest of all. </p>
		  <p> <B>Traveller - respected</B><BR>
			A useful tool, though only recently discovered. Irekei are generally 
			distrustful of the mysterious Runegates, but a few brave wizards have 
			begun to unravel their secrets and investigate the possibilities of 
			raids upon far-away lands. </p>
		  <p> <B>Undead Hunter - respected</B><BR>
			A dangerous, unhealthy occupation. But the Undead can be found everywhere, 
			even the desert, and some Irekei specialize in combatting their rotting 
			forms. The Undead fear fire, and they shall fear the inner fire of 
			any Irekei who chooses to remove their mishapen presence from the 
			world. </p>
