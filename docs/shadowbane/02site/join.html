		Once the game actually begins, Shadowclan has an open membership policy,

		<p><span class="txt">Anyone who wishes to join Shadowclan, must be born 
		  into the Clan. IE, new characters are <b>REQUIRED</b>. There are many 
		  reasons for this, the main one being the fact that 'growing' your character

		  should be prepared to limit their character's interactions with non-Irekei.</span> 
		  <p><span class="txt"> There may be physical requirements for character

		  <p><span class="txt"> There are no proposed limitations for class choice 
			at this time, though this may be subject to change as Beta progresses 
			and we have a chance to get a better feel for the game.</span>
		  <p><span class="txt"> ROLEPLAY (see the <a href="./philosophy.html">Ways 
			of the Clan</a> section). Stay in-character - No references to the 
			world outside of Shadowbane. Use of the <a href="./language.html">Irekei

			is inapporopriate you will NOT be allowed to join Shadowclan).</span>
		  <p><span class="txt"> HAVE FUN without ruining the fun of others.</span>
		  <p><span class="txt"> Come prepared to LEARN. Expect at the <b><i>very

			must achieve and maintain.</span>
		  <p><span class="txt"> Come prepared to SHARE AND SACRAFICE. Shadowbane 
			is a community where each individual is expected to work for the improvement 
			of that community rather than individual gain. Lower ranked members

		  <p><span class="txt"> NO EXPLOITS. Shadowclan members do not abuse bugs, 
			cheats, external programs or ways to gain power or wealth that the

  </blockquote>
  <p><span class="txt"><u>Looting</u>:</span></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span class="txt">Looting proceeds according to the chain of command. The 
      highest Clan member gets first choice of loot from all monster and player 
      corpses. Lower-ranked members should not even touch any corpses until all 
      of those ranked above them have already picked over the loot or the higher-ranked 
      members have given them special permission to do so for that instance. On 
      a related note, higher-ranked members are expected to help out the lower-ranked 
      members as needed with new equipment and/or repairs. They are also allowed 
      to distribute looted equipment to lower-ranked members. Non-Clan members 
      that are in the area or along on the trip should never touch any corpses 
      unless specifically told to do so by the highest ranking Clan member present.</span></p>

  <p><span class="txt"><u>Out-of-Game Behaviour</u>:</span></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span class="txt">All Shadowclan members are expected to be mature in actions 
      if not years. Any immature behaviour by a Shadowclan Player reflects badly 
      on the guild as a whole, especially if done under the Shadowclan name or 
      the character's name. </span></p>
