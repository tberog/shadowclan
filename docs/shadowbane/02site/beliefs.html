<td ALIGN=CENTER><span class="txt">Our father is, <i>Kryquo’khalin</i>, The Terror, The Dragon, Shaker 
  of Worlds and Creator of the Sun; our mother, <i>Khalikryst</i>, The Phoenix, 
  The Transforming Flame.
  <p>  We worship the Great Dragon. It was he who cleansed our spirits 
  with fire and made us into the superior beings we are today. The sundering of 
  the world is the first signs of the waking of the Dragon. It is up to us to 
  conquer the weak <i>fir'khanim</i> and finish what has already begun. The Great 
  Dragon <b>will</b> awaken, and when it does the world shall burn with it's holy 
  fire from which only the strong will emerge. We will be those survivors, for 
  we have tested ourselves, culled the weak, and our veins pulse with the very 
  breath of the Dragon, rich in power and ready to prove ourselves as worthy.
<p>The <i>khar'ika</i> is the primal essence of the Dragon with which 
  we have been imbued. The <i>khar'ika</i> burns bright in those who are strong, 
  and such leaders are visible for all Irekei to see. Those who betray the Dragon 
  or their brethren have their <i>khar'ika</i> dimmed. To extinguish an Irekei's 
  <i>khar'ika</i>, is to extinguish their life. Those who are strong and fierce, 
  with a <i>khar'ika</i> that flames brightly, will be absorbed by the Dragon 
  at the World's End, and will burn forever.</span></td>

  "While most Irekei prefer to fight with wickedly 
  curved blades, some Warriors walk the Shining Way instead. These Warriors, called 
  Sun Dancers, fight without any weapons at all, harnessing their khar'ika to 
  turn their bare hands into deadly weapons."<br>
  <i>-Quote from official Irekei info</i> 
  <p>These Holy Warriors are considered to be 'Touched 
	by the Dragon' and are held in high esteem. The<i>ir khar'ika</i> burns brightest 
	of all, and they often lead asctetic lifestyles. Some choose to never speak 
	while others shun material possessions. Their devotion to their <i>virakt</i> 
	and to the Great Dragon, Terror of Terrors is legendary. The sight of The 
	Sun Dancers on the battlefield has often sent lesser warriors fleeing for 
	their lives.</span></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT><span class="txt"><b>On the Turning and the Trees of Life:</b><br> 
  When the High King of the <i>fir'khanim</i> was 
  slain beneath the Great Tree, his blood stained the bark and seeped down through 
  the roots. The Dragon tasted the blood and turned restlessly in his slumber, 
  shattering the world into pieces. The Dragon's Flame consumed the blood and 
  imbued the Great Tree with its own <i>khar'ika</i>, transforming the way of 
  life for all the races. Now, noone may truly die and a new test is upon us. 
  All are now bound to the Great Tree and its offspring, but it is to the ShadowClan 
  that this honour rightfully belongs. All others using the Trees of the Dragon 
  without permission are blasphemers. Some heretical Irekei have claimed that 
  the other races were now imbued with their own <i>khar'ika</i> and had been 
  elevated above thier previous mortality, deserving our respect as servants of 
  the Dragon. These heretics were flayed upon the sands and their names forever 
  erased from our history. Only their treachery is remembered. The Trees of the 
  Dragon are considered sacred in Irekei culture and are always treated with great 
  respect and honour. At almost any time of day in any Irekei city you can find 
  one or another of its inhabitants making offerings to their Tree and every coming 
  of age ceremony includes the young Irekei giving their own life blood to the 
  Clan Tree as a sign of devotion.</span></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT><span class="txt"><b>On Other Races:</b><br> 
  Irekei are very suspicious of other races, and often even leery 
  of their own. The <i>fir'khanim</i> concept of the handshake has never been 
  accepted in Irekei culture, as outsiders are cold and clammy to the touch compared 
  to their burning skin. A stiff bow at the waist is the common method of acknowledging 
  a respected leader, elder or peer, but even this token of respect is given almost 
  exclusively within their own Clan. For an outsider to be afforded such an honor 
  is almost unheard of.</span></td>

		<span class="txt"><i>"I do not know much about the world outside the Burning 
		Lands. However, my grandfather, who is well travelled and wise, told me 
		this..."</i> 
		<p> <b>Aelfborn</b> - Unhealthy crossbreeds driven to madness by the conflicts 
		  within their tainted blood. They mar their skins with magical runes 
		  in an attempt to keep their broken bodies whole. Damaged, sterile and 
		  outcast from both of their parent races, these half-breeds have no place 
		  in our world and make poor<i> jov'uus</i>.</p>
  		<p><b>Aracoix</b> - Since the Turning of the Dragon, these Bird-men have been 
		  seen in the skies. Strange creatures beyond words, are they not? Do 
		  you think because they soar in the sky, they are above the Irekei? Hah! 
		  Once their wings are clipped, they perish as quickly as any other <i>fir'khanim</i>.</p>
  		<p><b>Centaurs</b> - Union of horse and human. The Horse-Men are a powerful 
		  fighting force in the Greenlands, but they wilt in the desert as quickly 
		  as the rest. Boastful slayers of Dragon-kin. This alone makes them the 
		  target of Irekei animosity.</p>
  		<p><b>Dwarves</b> - These automatons of the mortal gods are odd beings 
		  indeed. Carved of stone but seemingly possessed of their own intelligence. 
		  Though they have no internal fire the Dwarves are crafters of fine weapons 
		  and slayers of the giants. This makes 'The Stone Men' somewhat more 
		  respected than the <i>fir'khanim</i>, and Dwarven traders are not unknown 
		  among some Irekei settlements. of course, the same qualities that make 
		  them worth trading with also often make them the target of Irekei raids. 
		  At least they don't bleed rain. Some say the Stone Men are the ones 
		  who have locked away The Dragon. If such is true, it is a futile attempt, 
		  for when the Dragon awakes, no cage shall hinder the fate that will 
		  befall the world.</p>
  		<p><b>Elves</b> - Words cannot describe how Irekei despise our most ancient 
		  enemies, the Hateful Ones. Once they deemed themselves mighty, but they 
		  were proven to be weak and soft. We laughed as their Empire was torn 
		  down by the Humans and their peoples hunted like animals. Its unfortunate 
		  that their extermination was never completed. Want a sure death? Compare 
		  an Irekei to an Elf.</p>
  		<p><b>Half-Giants</b> - Half-giants are freaks of nature wrought through decadent 
		  cross-breeding. They are no better than the humans they are born of, 
		  and their great size merely makes them an easier target, Unnaturally 
		  strong and dumb, they must be thoroughly beaten into submission if they 
		  are to be made into acceptable <i>jov'uus</i>.</p>
  		<p><b>Humans</b> - Favorites of the Great Meddler. Though they claim to be many 
		  distinct peoples, they all look similar to these eyes of mine. And their 
		  blood flows in the same color. I know, for my blade has tasted them 
		  all. Devil-men, they call us, comparing us with old fears from their 
		  legends. They are right to fear us, for the Dragon has no place for 
		  them amongst his Chosen. As a whole they are weak, yet rarely you may 
		  find one who seems to have some inner fire of their own. Trust none 
		  of them. They are far too unpredictable. Do not expect anything more 
		  than a sharp knife in the back from a human. Better to take from them 
		  what you can and let the desert have the rest. Some make good <i>jov'uus</i>. 
		  Most do not.</p>
  		<p><b>Shades</b> - Tainted by the Turning, humans have begun to give birth to 
		  these abominations. Pale as death and cold to the touch, these quasi-humans 
		  seem to lack even the puny heat a normal human generates. They are the 
		  weakest of the <i>fir'khanim</i> and do not even have enough of a spark 
		  within their beings to sire offspring. Their existence is the truest 
		  sign the Meddler has met his end in the claws and teeth of The Dragon.</p>
  		<p><b>Minotaur</b> - Mishapen, brutal creatures born of the Elven folly. Though 
		  strong and savage, Minotaurs do not last long when they face the true 
		  test on the Burning Sands. Do not dirty your hands on any you might 
		  find dead. It is best to leave their bloated, diseased caracasses to 
		  the <i>Skath</i>. Let them roam in the Frozen North until The Dragon 
		  rises, burning them to ash where they stand.</p>
  <p class="txt"><b>Irekei</b> - There are too many of our people who have forsaken 
	themselves and the Dragon. These heretics must be shown their error of their 
	ways. If they will not join us or bow down in homage, then they leave us no 
	choice but to destroy them and extinguish their <i>khar'ika.</i></p></span></td>
