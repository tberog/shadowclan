  <h2>Origins of the Dragon</h2>
  <i class="txt">As told by Vas'khanim</i> 
</center>
<p class="txt">In the time before, there was nothing but The Void and the stars. 
  Great beings of incomprehensible power traversed the vast spaces, devouring 
  the energy of the stars and fighting amongst themselves for supremacy. The greatest 
  among these was one who was nameless but would later be known as, <i>Kryquo’khalin</i>, 
  the Terror of Terrors. For unmeasureable aeons, these beings fought, only to 
  be vanquished; either destroyed or chased to the unknown depths of The Void. 
  Victorious over all of the lesser ones, the Dragon, alone, gorged upon the energy 
  of stars too numerous to count. Satiated, the Dragon slept, curled up for an 
  eternity. The sleeping giant dreamt, and from its dreams sprang the very world 
  we live upon. The fire from the Dragon warmed the earth and many species and 
  manners of beings appeared, though only one would later be chosen as worthy 
  of the Dragon. </p>
<p class="txt">There the Dragon slumbered for untold millenia while the peoples 
  upon its back prospered and grew, unknowing of their true origins. Attracted 
  to the energy and heat radiating from the world, some of the Dragon's foes that 
  had escaped its grasp in the Before-time came to this place and used their powers 
  to meddle with its peoples. Annoyed at such audacity, the Dragon stirred in 
  its sleep, and eventually awoke, confronting these Meddlers in the Great Battle. 
  Long was the battle fought, and much was destroyed before the Dragon returned 
  to slumber. The foes rejoiced, believing themselves victorious.But, in their 
  ignorance, they were unaware that the true goal of the Dragon's waking had already 
  been accomplished. </p>
<p class="txt">For <i>Kryquo’khalin</i>, infinitely wise in foresight, had used 
  its power to transform one of these lesser beings into <i>Khalikryst</i>, Phoenix 
  Goddess, the Transforming Fire, dread Lady of the Sun, she who would eventually 
  transform us in-turn, so that we coul realize our true purpose and serve the 
  Dragon as best we are able. </p>
<p class="txt">But that tale is best left to another time.</p>
