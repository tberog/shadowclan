<h2 align="center">In the Wake of the Dragon</h2>
  
<p align="center"><i class="txt">as told by Saladyn</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="txt">A child fell that day.... As the lone family traveled the 
	path of rejection, of exile, and found no home in the three tribes, for hateful 
	news is like a fast running stream reaching towards a great river, they grew 
	gaunt and sickly.... It was as if all meat fled from them, as if all fruit 
	withered in their path and bloomed powerfully in their wake. They were deathless, 
	but hunger was a torture that always ended the same way for mortal or beyond.... 
	Living was eating away at the family, their servants were becoming ruthless 
	in their want, harboring wishes to murder one them.... on that day, a child 
	fell... her pale skin was slick with sweat and, to some, those were like tears 
	for her own loss.... She fell in mid step and never rose again.</span></p>
  <p><span class="txt"> The father, the exiled lord, wailed against his people 
	and all their tribes-- they were pigs, one and all, but too weak for the power 
	he wished to harness... So weak they feared him for it. So weak they exiled 
	him, all his blood, all who knew him and all who touched him. The day the 
	child died they were far away from all they knew... far into warmer lands 
	covered in tall trees, wild animals and moisture so thick it choked the breath... 
	the sky was lit with flame.</span></p>
  <p><span class="txt">They saw a shadow too great to look upon without shuddering, 
	without the impulse to run... It was no beast but a living, moving continent... 
	but its grace was undeniable. Some did run, a few servants and one of the 
	cousins, but in their mourning and the grim knowledge that death had been 
	their constant companion since they'd left the cool lands in the north, the 
	family stood their ground. The father took a step forward... with a soft, 
	mad laugh, he fell to his knees in homage... and the beast saw it. The Great 
	Dragon's eye, red like blood, focused on them with amusement. What greater 
	tribute is there than worship? Its path changed and those who ran turned back... 
	for it grew even larger as it came towards the ground... and they knew there 
	was no escape.</span></p>
  <p><span class="txt">The dragon lit the child first-- the rest were scorched 
	in its wake.... Those who ran became cinder, but not before torturing flame 
	ate their bones within them and popped their marrow like oil. But the lord, 
	who stood his ground, and his family were... changed. Whatever flame touched 
	their skin seeped into them like water... it stole their water, causing them 
	to writhe in agony.... it seemed as if the burning would never end. The Dragon's 
	game was not done, for once the flame was lit in its heart, it knew to purge 
	all it saw.... The trees were enflamed. The animals, the living the dead the 
	ground and even the sky seemed to turn red.... and then, as quickly and quietly 
	as it came, it went; its wake created a great breath which cooled the plains. 
	And lo, they were desert. The Burning Lands.</span></p>
  <p><span class="txt">The father was first to wake... his skin, once pale and 
	tinted in blue, was black as pitch. He looked back towards his family... as 
	the flame fled from the child back through them, they were varying shades. 
	Closest to him, they were black... then red... then crimson and brighter still.</span></p>
  <p><span class="txt">They looked about themselves in shock, for the trees and 
	life were gone from this place. They were surrounded by sand. There would 
	be harsh living, food would be scarce... but they knew they could not leave 
	this place. A flame was warm in their chests and they asknowledged it with 
	respect. They were alive with the desert's craving, with the Dragon's touch, 
	with the sun's wrath.</span></p>
  <p><span class="txt">They looked in the direction the Dragon had passed, but 
	it was gone.... Still, they bowed to his wake... drew themselves up, now naked 
	and hard-skinned... and set out into the desert; to prove the Dragon had not 
	wasted itself, that they were worthy of its return... for it would return... 
	it would purge the world. When it did, the old tribes would flee and burn... 
	But they, the family of Irkay would survive. To survive, to live dangerously, 
	to challenge the desert... that was all the offering they could give to the 
	Dragon in thanks. For as they were dying, he burned them and gave them life.</span></p>
