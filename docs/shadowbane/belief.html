<!-- Updates should be placed only between Comment Tags marked as "Edit Text Begins" and "Edit Text Ends"

There are 4 levels of Text: H1 for main heading, H2 for sub-headings, H5 for cutlines and sub-sub-headings, and P for all ordinary text.

Links will automatically appear as defined by the style sheet.

Do not edit any of the DIV tags.

There are 4 DIV IDs:

1) TOP contains the image at the top of the page. This DIV does not need to be edited by page or section updaters. This DIV contains no text.

2) LEFT contains the menu in the left column. Standard HTML hyperlink rules apply. Each link is separated by the XMTL tag <br />

3) MIDDLE contains the copy for the page. Follow nomal HTML 4 rules or XMTL rules as defined by the W3C XHTML 1.0 Transitional DTD. Allowable tags are <P></P>, <H1></H1>, <H2></H2>, <H5></H5>. Please do not use non-breaking spaces to indent paragraph beginnings, all copy is flush left/ragged right.

If you insert a table into this column please do not used fixed-width table or cell setings, the MIDDLE column floats to match the width of the browser window. Do not fix a table width, but do fix cell widths at percentages of 100 (i.e., 3 columnn tables would have cell widths of 33,33,33).

Images set into the middle column should be no wider than 250 pixels in order to avoid odd behaviours. Do not insert images without optimizing them for web viewing and specifying the image's dimensions in the tag.

4) RIGHT DIV ID is for supplementalinformation, highlighting points of importance and for small images no wider than 110 pixels.

A note on IMAGES: by default only small size images appear on any full page. If there is a need for a larger image to appear, link the smaller image to the larger image and have the larger appear alone in its own browser window. the IMG tag should indicate target="blank" in order for this to work.

    FAQ</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Our father is, <i>Kryquo’khalin </i>, The Terror, The Dragon, Shaker of Worlds 
    and Creator of the Sun; our mother, <i>Khalikryst </i>, The Phoenix, The Transforming 
    Flame. </p>
  <p> We worship the Great Dragon. It was he who cleansed our spirits with fire 
    and made us into the superior beings we are today. The sundering of the world 
    is the first signs of the waking of the Dragon. It is up to us to conquer 
    the weak <i>fir'khanim</i> and finish what has already begun. The Great Dragon 
    <b>will</b> awaken, and when it does the world shall burn with it's holy fire 
    from which only the strong will emerge. We will be those survivors, for we 
    have tested ourselves, culled the weak, and our veins pulse with the very 
    breath of the Dragon, rich in power and ready to prove ourselves as worthy. 
    <p>The <i>khar'ika</i> is the primal essence of the Dragon with which we have 
      been imbued. The <i>khar'ika</i> burns bright in those who are strong, and 
      such leaders are visible for all Irekei to see. Those who betray the Dragon 
      or their brethren have their <i>khar'ika</i> dimmed. To extinguish an Irekei's 
      <i>khar'ika</i>, is to extinguish their life. Those who are strong and fierce, 
      with a <i>khar'ika</i> that flames brightly, will be absorbed by the Dragon 
      at the World's End, and will burn forever.

        <p> 
          <blockquote class="txt"> Irekei religion is based around four tenets:<br>
            <b>The Dragon</b> that made us what we are and will one day awaken 
            and devour the World.<br>
            <b>The Fire</b> that cleansed our spirits and burns within us still.<br>
            <b>The Sun</b> that burns as we do.<br>
            <b>The Sands</b> that continually test our resolve and fortitude.</blockquote>
          <p class="txt"><i><a href="wordsoffire.html"><b>&quot;Words of Fire, 
            Words of Ash&quot; </b></a></i><i><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp; - Motivational sermon as spoken by Ahri before the great 
            battle of the Whispering Towers</i></p>
          <p class="txt"><b>On Sun Dancers: </b><br>
            "While most Irekei prefer to fight with wickedly curved blades, some 
            Warriors walk the Shining Way instead. These Warriors, called Sun 
            Dancers, fight without any weapons at all, harnessing their khar'ika 
            to turn their bare hands into deadly weapons."<br>
          </p>
          <p>These Holy Warriors are considered to be 'Touched by the Dragon' 
            and are held in high esteem. Their <i>khar'ika</i> burns brightest 
            of all, and they often lead asctetic lifestyles. Some choose to never 
            speak while others shun material possessions. Their devotion to their 
            <i>virakt</i> and to the Great Dragon, Terror of Terrors is legendary. 
            The sight of The Sun Dancers on the battlefield has often sent lesser 
            warriors fleeing for their lives. 
            <p><b>On the Turning and the Trees of Life:</b><br>
              When the High King of the <i>fir'khanim</i> was slain beneath the 
              Great Tree, his blood stained the bark and seeped down through the 
              roots. The Dragon tasted the blood and turned restlessly in his 
              slumber, shattering the world into pieces. The Dragon's Flame consumed 
              the blood and imbued the Great Tree with its own <i>khar'ika</i>, 
              transforming the way of life for all the races. Now, noone may truly 
              die and a new test is upon us. All are now bound to the Great Tree 
              and its offspring, but it is to the ShadowClan that this honour 
              rightfully belongs. All others using the Trees of the Dragon without 
              permission are blasphemers. Some heretical Irekei have claimed that 
              the other races were now imbued with their own <i>khar'ika</i> and 
              had been elevated above thier previous mortality, deserving our 
              respect as servants of the Dragon. These heretics were flayed upon 
              the sands and their names forever erased from our history. Only 
              their treachery is remembered. The Trees of the Dragon are considered 
              sacred in Irekei culture and are always treated with great respect 
              and honour. At almost any time of day in any Irekei city you can 
              find one or another of its inhabitants making offerings to their 
              Tree and every coming of age ceremony includes the young Irekei 
              giving their own life blood to the Clan Tree as a sign of devotion. 
            </p>
            <p><b>On Other Races:</b><br>
              Irekei are very suspicious of other races, and often even leery 
              of their own. The <i>fir'khanim</i> concept of the handshake has 
              never been accepted in Irekei culture, as outsiders are cold and 
              clammy to the touch compared to their burning skin. A stiff bow 
              at the waist is the common method of acknowledging a respected leader, 
              elder or peer, but even this token of respect is given almost exclusively 
              within their own Clan. For an outsider to be afforded such an honor 
              is almost unheard of. </p>
            <p><i>"I do not know much about the world outside the Burning Lands. 
              However, my grandfather, who is well travelled and wise, told me 
              this..." </i> </p>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Aelfborn</b> - Unhealthy crossbreeds driven to 
              madness by the conflicts within their tainted blood. They mar their 
              skins with magical runes in an attempt to keep their broken bodies 
              whole. Damaged, sterile and outcast from both of their parent races, 
              these half-breeds have no place in our world and make poor<i> jov'uus</i>. 
            </p>
            <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Aracoix</b> - Since the Turning of the Dragon, these 
              Bird-men have been seen in the skies. Strange creatures beyond words, 
              are they not? Do you think because they soar in the sky, they are 
              above the Irekei? Hah! Once their wings are clipped, they perish 
              as quickly as any other <i>fir'khanim</i>. </p>
            <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Centaurs</b> - Union of horse and human. The Horse-Men 
              are a powerful fighting force in the Greenlands, but they wilt in 
              the desert as quickly as the rest. Boastful slayers of Dragon-kin. 
              This alone makes them the target of Irekei animosity. </p>
            <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwarves</b> - These automatons of the mortal gods 
              are odd beings indeed. Carved of stone but seemingly possessed of 
              their own intelligence. Though they have no internal fire the Dwarves 
              are crafters of fine weapons and slayers of the giants. This makes 
              'The Stone Men' somewhat more respected than the <i>fir'khanim</i>, 
              and Dwarven traders are not unknown among some Irekei settlements. 
              of course, the same qualities that make them worth trading with 
              also often make them the target of Irekei raids. At least they don't 
              bleed rain. Some say the Stone Men are the ones who have locked 
              away The Dragon. If such is true, it is a futile attempt, for when 
              the Dragon awakes, no cage shall hinder the fate that will befall 
              the world. </p>
            <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Elves</b> - Words cannot describe how Irekei despise 
              our most ancient enemies, the Hateful Ones. Once they deemed themselves 
              mighty, but they were proven to be weak and soft. We laughed as 
              their Empire was torn down by the Humans and their peoples hunted 
              like animals. Its unfortunate that their extermination was never 
              completed. Want a sure death? Compare an Irekei to an Elf. </p>
            <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Half-Giants</b> - Half-giants are freaks of nature 
              wrought through decadent cross-breeding. They are no better than 
              the humans they are born of, and their great size merely makes them 
              an easier target, Unnaturally strong and dumb, they must be thoroughly 
              beaten into submission if they are to be made into acceptable <i>jov'uus</i>. 
            </p>
            <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Humans</b> - Favorites of the Great Meddler. Though 
              they claim to be many distinct peoples, they all look similar to 
              these eyes of mine. And their blood flows in the same color. I know, 
              for my blade has tasted them all. Devil-men, they call us, comparing 
              us with old fears from their legends. They are right to fear us, 
              for the Dragon has no place for them amongst his Chosen. As a whole 
              they are weak, yet rarely you may find one who seems to have some 
              inner fire of their own. Trust none of them. They are far too unpredictable. 
              Do not expect anything more than a sharp knife in the back from 
              a human. Better to take from them what you can and let the desert 
              have the rest. Some make good <i>jov'uus</i>. Most do not. </p>
            <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shades</b> - Tainted by the Turning, humans have 
              begun to give birth to these abominations. Pale as death and cold 
              to the touch, these quasi-humans seem to lack even the puny heat 
              a normal human generates. They are the weakest of the <i>fir'khanim</i> 
              and do not even have enough of a spark within their beings to sire 
              offspring. Their existence is the truest sign the Meddler has met 
              his end in the claws and teeth of The Dragon. </p>
            <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Minotaur</b> - Mishapen, brutal creatures born of 
              the Elven folly. Though strong and savage, Minotaurs do not last 
              long when they face the true test on the Burning Sands. Do not dirty 
              your hands on any you might find dead. It is best to leave their 
              bloated, diseased caracasses to the <i>Skath</i>. Let them roam 
              in the Frozen North until The Dragon rises, burning them to ash 
              where they stand. </p>
            <p class="txt"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Irekei</b> - There are too many of our 
              people who have forsaken themselves and the Dragon. These heretics 
              must be shown their error of their ways. If they will not join us 
              or bow down in homage, then they leave us no choice but to destroy 
              them and extinguish their <i>khar'ika.</i> </p>

  <p>The Nkoth Wastes and Kharduun are considered sacred areas. These areas are 
    off-limit to ALL fir'khanim. Any found in these spots are to give tribute 
    to honor the Great Dragon and as an apology for poaching. They are then to 
    leave the zone immediately. Failure to do so will result in death.</p>
