<h1>Shadowclan Arkhakts</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Shadowclan Virakt is divided into three large divisions,
referred to as <i>Arkhakts</i>. They are detailed below.</p>

<hr width="80%" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Arhalar'khalin: Followers of the Sun</h3>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The Arhalar are a nomadic people, never settling in any one
location for long. Instead they pledge themselves to the trees of
the other Arkhakt based on their current needs and goals. Like a
Serpent slithering from view, the Arhalar seem to posses the
ability to become as the wind and move without being seen, or to
materialize in a room once thought to be empty. Because of this
ability the Irekei say that the only time you see the Arhalar is
when they wish to be seen. The Arhalar have made a power of
themselves among the virakt politically, being the ones who know
all. They hear words not intended to be heard, and see things that
should not have been seen. This information is found very useful to
the other Arkhakt&rsquo;s, so most try to encourage the Arhalar to
make camp within the walls of their city. With their abilities and
connections they have become the ultimate political tools for the
Virakt, performing missions of espionage, sabotage, and
assassination.</p>

<p>The Arhalar&rsquo;khalin are very much traditionalist and take
great pride in their ability with their fists, the sun dancers are
held in very high regard. In all Arhalar duels, contestants strip
down to only their loin wraps to fight hand to hand in a fierce
contest to the death.</p>

<h2>There are three leaders of this Arkhakt:</h2>

<p>Jhular&rsquo;khalin: He who greets the sun, this is the main
Arkhakt leader.<br />
 Vir'jhalakar: The great serpent, the most reliable and successful
assassin.<br />
 Archalan: He that creates the future. This is the highest ranking
caster, and the political adviser to the Jhular&rsquo;khalin.</p>

<h2>The Arkhakt equipment restrictions will be the same as the
virakt with the following additional limitations:</h2>

<p><i>Light or medium armor only<br />
 Arhalar'khalin assassins may wear assassin armor<br />
 All new members of the Arkhakt will not be permitted to wear
footwear until they pass their first trial</i></p>

<h2>Other rules:</h2>

<p>It is the belief of the Arkhakt that the sand will tell you all
you need to know, if you remain in contact with it. So all young
Arha&rsquo;khalin are required to learn this method of
communication, though it is not uncommon to see older members still
practicing this tradition.</p>

<h2>The Arkhakt consists of two main divisions:</h2>

<p><b>Vir'jhalular</b> - The serpents (they who dance with sand)
are the main members of the Arkhakt. Only those who can disappear
from view on their own (e.g. Hide, stealth, or Invisibility spell)
may be a Vir'Jhalalar. All Arkhakt leaders come from this
division.</p>

<p><b>Ubarakar</b> - The Great Fists are Irekei that have been
bribed or bought into the service of the Vir'jhalular. It was
determined by the Archalan that having a military unit will be
necessary at the time of the Great War. Although not very
influential in the Arkhakt, the Ubarakar are still treated with
respect and thus in turn they have shown great devotion and
sacrifice to the Jhala&rsquo;khali and his vision.</p>

<p></p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Jhur'Ular: Those who Sting</h3>

<p>The path of of the scorpion is not for the meek. Only the most
courageous, bloodthirsty, and toughest Irekei are able to walk it.
Others cower in temples or in the shadows while we obtain glory for
Nkurakar on the field of battle.</p>

<p>To join the Arkhakt, a prospective member must pass three tests, one of each 
pillar. The test of blood is to prove your skill in battle, present to the Arkhalar 
a worthy trophy from an enemy that has fallen by your hand. The test of courage 
is to prove you are fearless, alone you must approach a large rabble of firkhanim 
and demand tribute, the final test, of toughness, the Irekei strips down naked 
and runs the gauntlet of the B'baash stronghold. Once these three trials have 
been passed, the initiate is welcomed into the Arkhakt. The Arkhakt will gather 
weekly. All tests will be given by the Arkhakt leadership.</p>

<p>Internally the Arkhakt is composed of many tribes. 10 Irekei are
required to found a tribe, and they are free to choose their own
restrictions and theme, provided it fits within the general theme
of the Arkhakt. Tribes dedicate themselves to the one of the three
pillars.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>The tribes may have their own internal hierchies, but the Arkhakt has a greater 
ranking structure. The Arkhakt has it's own structure. Krahg and Gaa are Arkhalar, 
there is one Jall'uus who commands the Arkhakt in battle, the Jall'uus is appointed 
at a great gathering called by the Arkhalar. The Jall'uus can choose two Jall'kruvular 
from any in the Arkhakt as his delegates/aides. After that are the Sek'alar, a 
rank given by the Arkhalar for outstanding service and dedication to the Arkhakt, 
follow by the Irikhan. Tribes must be approved by Arkhakt leadership beforehand.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Urikhan, prove yourself worthy through your actions, show
yourself to be a strong and intelligent Irekei, dedicate yourself
to the virakt above any personal needs, demonstrate ability to
organise and lead groups, and you will be approached by an Arkhalar
with an invitation to be tested and inducted into the Arkhakt.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>Other notes:</h2>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Only splint mail, platemail, field plate and dragon's plate
heavy armour may be worn by Arkhakt members(who use heavy armour).
We feel the shiny plate is a weak vanity and doesn't fit the style
of the Arkhakt well.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The recommended greeting between Arkhakt members is a howl and a
salute.</p>

<h3>Seva'ubar: Order of the Cut Hand</h3>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>The Order of the Cut Hand (Seva'ubar) is an organization of
Shadowclan Irekei given the duty to defend the pathways to the
Dragon. The process for initiation into the Cut Hand begins after
an Irekei passes his test into adulthood. He symbolizes his
devotion to the Terror by dropping his or her last name and
henceforth only responds to his first name. The second step is a
pilgrimage into the desert to commune with the Dragon, to hear his
blood pumping beneath the surface and hear him breath and blow sand
across the desert. The road to advancement within the Arkhakt
requires an innate understanding of the dunes and campsites around
Khar. At the highest level of understanding, one learns the paths
that Jall&rsquo;kroda and P&rsquo;reklabar herself took. Member of
the Arkhakt also learn the history behind selected and important
holy sites and the overall direction the stars show our Virakt is
taking.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Because of the training involved, many members of the Cut Hand
become historians, keepers of the Virakt&rsquo;s lore. They make
sure all Irekei understand where the holy sites are and what
appropriate behavior is at said sites. The Cut Hand defends those
sites with zeal and fanaticism against both Fir&rsquo;khanim
incursions as well as against heretical Irekei with un-illuminated
khar&rsquo;ika. The ultimate goal of the Cut Hand is to bring about
the Krykhan&rsquo;jallakar, the war to end all wars and bring the
Dragon back into the desert. To this end they view all visions and
prophesies as sacrosanct. Members of the Virakt with powers in
these areas are recruited for the order early on and held in the
highest esteem.</p>

<p>When Jall&rsquo;kroda ascended from the darkness after communing
with the Dragon, he paused at the entrance to the catacombs. He
formed a depression in the sand with the palm of his right hand. He
took out a long obsidian dagger and drew it along his hand from
right to left. His blood dripped slowly into the depression. Sand
from the sides of the bowl crumbled down and mingled with the
blood. The howling winds that managed to squeeze by
Jall&rsquo;kroda hit the blood and caused the sand and blood to
swirl around rapidly. Jall&rsquo;kroda stared at the blood, at the
sand, and in the swirling motion he beheld a majestic drake. It
stared at him from the other side of the swirling blood and sand
and slowly spread its wings out, causing all he saw to turn black.
Two tall Irekei figures slowly became distinguishable in the murk,
dressed in Dragon Armor standing guard outside the catacombs. Next
to each of the strong and tall Irekei were a Terror Priest and a
Blood Prophet. They stood by as well as wave after wave of
Fir&rsquo;khanim swept toward them. The Irekei called out
'Seva'ubar&rsquo; over and over as the long curved weapons flashed
in the sun, cutting down the invaders. Explosions flew from the
illuminated hands of the Terror Priest and Blood Prophet. Their
faces shined from beneath from a khar'ika that was unparalleled.
The image faded as quickly as it came and Jall&rsquo;kroda went
back to his Virakt with the knowledge of what was required. The
Order of the Cut Hand was born and its totem decided upon.</p>

<p><b>The Haaj:</b> This is the holiest of councils. Terror
priests, Mages, and Furies forsake all: wealth, family, prestige in
a quest to gain access to the Dragon. This group is a small sect of
the Cut Hand, most zealous and fanatical about how the Virakt and
the holy sites should be maintained. A few have even been know to
gain communication from the Dragon though the last to gain access
died many years ago before the Sundering.</p>

<p><b>The Gaur:</b> Made up of the strongest Dragon Warriors of the
Cut Hand, this group of warriors trains for the end of all days.
They are the shock troops of the Cut Hand, often crashing into the
fray and leaving dazed and confused enemies for the bulk of the War
party to deal with.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p><b>The Shaa:</b> This is the branch of the Cut Hand that patrols
the sands incessantly for incursions and defilement. They slay
unwary enemies and Irekei killers. Those that advance throught the
ranks the highest become personal guards for the leaders of the Cut
Hand. Some advance to leadership positions themselves , organizing
the patrol network and intelligence gathering required to keep the
sands clean.</p>

<p></p>

<p><b>The Voi:</b> This is the bread and butter of the Virakt.
These are Irekei that simply live a virtuous life and adhere to the
precepts of the Cut Hand. They view the sands as holy and are ready
to defend the passage to the dragon from possible invaders at a
moments notice. While they aren't as zealous in their beliefs, no
one questions their devotion to the Arkhakt and to some extent they
can accomplish more simply because of their more pragmatic
demeanor.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Each Irekei in the Arkhakt is free to develop other structures
within the Arkhakt as long as they fit the lore intensive aspect
and recognize the defense of the sands as paramount. Just give me a
heads up so we can work on it.</p>
